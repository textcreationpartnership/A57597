            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He two firſt, and preliminary Diſcourſes (as I have called them) being a genuine Preface to the enſuing Book, I might and ſhould have forborn to have written any thing by way of Epiſtle, but that I was willing to tell thee what is the method, and what the deſign of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, not knowing but it might gratify thee, (as it uſeth to do my ſelf) to have a kinde of Synopſis, or general view of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors drift, and ſcope, in, and throughout his whole Book: as alſo, for that I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make a juſt Apology, for ſome few things, which I knew not but the more cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſort of Readers might object againſt; as namely, the length of the Book, the Independency of one Diſcourſe upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. Firſt as for the Book it ſelf, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of four parts: The firſt of which (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſpatched thoſe Preliminary Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb facs="tcp:60264:3"/>which are in the nature of a Preface) proceedeth to treat of all, or moſt of thoſe ſins, whereby (as Scripture informeth us) God hath been provoked firſt, and laſt, to bring the Judgment of Fire.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part containeth ſome few ſtrictures of Philoſophy, touching the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Phyſical cauſes of Fire, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſad and wonderful effects we have ſeen of it, one would think ſhould put eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ingenious Man upon inquiry, what this ſame Fire is, which as an inſtrument in Gods hand hath done ſuch great things, and laid ſo famous a City (or the moſt of it) flat, in leſs than four days time. Some part e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the ſecond part is intelligible enough even by thoſe that are no Scholars; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome paſſages therein are not to be underſtood by others, I have made that part as much ſhorter than the other three, (which they that run may read and underſtand) as the number of Perſons in <hi>England,</hi> that are competently Scholars, may be ſuppoſed to fall ſhort of their number that are in no wiſe ſuch, it being, though a fourth diviſion, yet not about a twelfth or fourteenth part in proportion to the bulk and bigneſs of the whole Book, and yet not without its moral applications neither, eaſie enough to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:60264:3"/>
            <p>The third part reflecteth upon all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſages, and circumſtances, of the late dreadful Fire, (which the Author could well think, or inform himſelf of,) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make ſome practical uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all or moſt of them: as alſo glanceth at ſome few other things, either paſſages of Scripture, or otherwiſe, that ſeem cognate, or to have competent affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the ſubject in hand, as namely thoſe analogical Fires (if I may ſo term them) which we read of in Holy Writ, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tongues of Men, the Word of God, and the Heavenly Angels, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt part is wholly and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſant in wholeſome Counſels, and ſure Foundations of ſupport, and comfort, calculated, and propoſed, for the direction, and conſolation of thoſe that are under any kinde of ſufferings; but more particularly under this, <hi>viz.</hi> by the late Fire.</p>
            <p>Having given you this bill of fare (if I may ſo call it) or account of what you are here to expect, ſuffer me to do my ſelf that right, as to prevent (ſo far as I may) ſome obvious (and yet I hope) groundleſs obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which the more ſevere ſort of Readers, may be inclined to make againſt the inſuing Treatiſe. Some I doubt will ſay it is too long
<pb facs="tcp:60264:4"/>and may fear it will tire them ere they get to the end of it. Such may pleaſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſo long a judgment (as I may call it in reference to the conſequences of it, though not to the continuance of the Fire its ſelf) could ſcarce be ſolemnly enough commemorated by a ſhort Diſcourſe, nor would a Book that might preſently be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, cauſe Men and Women to dwel long enough upon the remembrance of ſuch a Calamity as that, which ought never to be forgotten. Moreover, Diſcourſes to the number of a hundred and upwards (which number hath been occaſioned, much-what, by the deſire I had to gather up all the fragments (circumſtances I mean) of this Judgment, that nothing might be loſt) could not eaſily be couched or contained in a very ſmall room. And as for matter of tiring or wearying your ſelves, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity of this Book, I think that need not be, if you will but reſt and pauſe a while at every ſtage, there being above a hundred ſtages, or reſting places, (for each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Meditation and Diſcourſe, I reckon to be ſuch) where you may take breath, and refreſh your ſelves, as long as you pleaſe, before you proceed in your journey, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch termes even pthiſical and ſhort
<pb facs="tcp:60264:4"/>winded perſons are able to travel, were it a hundred miles an end.</p>
            <p>Some it may be, will think I have reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much upon the Popiſh party (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon ſome of them:) in relation to the Fire: others again, that I have reflected upon them too little, not poſitively and confidently enough. To the former, give me leave to ſay, that if I have here and there inſinuated, that ſome of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with thoſe that did hatch the 5. of <hi>November</hi> Powder-Plot, (I ſay ſome, not all, nor it may be the moſt of them) are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſumed, and vehemently ſuſpected to have had a hand in the burning of <hi>London;</hi> it is but what moſt of thoſe Treatiſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late fire that I have ſeen, (which got into the World before this, though this were almoſt ready for the birth long ſince.)</p>
            <p>I ſay it is but what the moſt of them have given ſhrewd intimations of; ſo that I am not the firſt that hath entertained any ſuch hard thoughts concerning ſome of them, nor do believe I ſhall be the laſt. Manifeſt it is that <hi>Hubert,</hi> (for ſo was his name that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf guilty of the burning of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and was executed at Tyburn for it) did die in the profeſſion of the Romiſh faith. For that he earneſtly denyed himſelf to
<pb facs="tcp:60264:5"/>have been a <hi>Hugonite;</hi> did declare that he did believe confeſſion to a Prieſt was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his ſalvation, and was accordingly confeſſed by a Popiſh Prieſt, and did make uſe of <hi>Avie Maries,</hi> for his uſual pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Had he not been of that perſwaſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commiſſion of this fact, or had he been really a mad-man, Papiſts would have been well conten that ſo infamous and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Perſon ſhould have profeſſed himſelf a <hi>Hugonite,</hi> at his death, neither would they have been ambitious to have proſelited ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo great a Malefactor (as others account him) or one that was really mad. To ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he ſhould do ſuch a thing without inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from others, (yea without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination and conſpiracy of others joyning with him) is no leſs beſides reaſon, than (if I miſtake not) contrary to his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If the Committee of Parliament which were appointed to examine how the Fire came, and was carryed on, did manifeſt no ſmall jealouſie, that it was by Popiſh trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery (after they had received the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and informations of many ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as in reference to the Fire) yea if the Parliament its ſelf, did ſince the Fire manifeſt a greater zeale and hotter diſpleaſure againſt the Papiſts than ever before, publiſhing to
<pb facs="tcp:60264:5"/>the World that they had been filled with complaints of the great Inſolencies of the Papiſts in ſeveral Counties; and if it be well known to many, that many Romaniſts have been very jocund and full of triumph ſince that Fire (as who ſhould ſay, ah, ah, ſo they would have it, or as one brings them in, ſaying <hi>Ah, this hit better than the Powder-plot.</hi>) I ſay if all theſe things may not warrant ſo much as a rational ſuſpicion that more Catholicks than that one that was executed for it, did promote the burning of <hi>London:</hi> I ſay, if from hence we have not a ſufficient ground to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſome of thoſe who are the enemies of Proteſtants as ſuch (and vehement ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is all I have inſinuated, leaving it to God in his due time, to make a further diſcovery of that matter, one way or other) let me paſſe for vainly cenſorious, which yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I ſhould not, when ſo great Authors have appeared to have the ſame ſentiments and ſuſpicions. Moreover when the Papiſts falſely ſay in their Apology, that he was a <hi>Hugonite</hi> Proteſtant, that ſaid he burnt the City (throwing the Odium of ſuch an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Proteſtants) (yet ſeeming tender of charging him too deep, in that they really abſolve him as to the fact, whilſt they accuſe him of a vain, that is falſe confeſſion (which
<pb facs="tcp:60264:6"/>had they taken him for a Proteſtant, they would ſcarce have done;) why may not we ſay (as the truth is) that he was a profeſſed Papiſt, and that at his very death? at which time Men leaſt dare to diſſemble. Yet on the other hand, I am poſitive and abſolute in charging no Man with the guilt of that fire, whom the Law its ſelf hath not charged with and condemned for it; nay I ſhall go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſo, and ſay, that if I ſhould ever be ſure that no more Papiſts than one had a hand in it, I ſhould be heartily ſorry that I ever harboured a miſtruſtful thought of any more of them, upon that account. I am or would be as earneſtly deſirous that all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts may appear innocent in this particular, in caſe they be ſo, as manifeſtly guilty, if they be guilty indeed: neither would I that a hair of any of their heads ſhould be ſinged for the burning of <hi>London,</hi> unleſs it can be proved demonſtratively that it was burnt by their meanes. As for a bare ſuſpicion that they did it, they deſerve, and invite no leſs, by manifeſting a great deale of joy (as ſome of them are ſaid to have expreſſed) ſince the time it was done.</p>
            <p>Some it may be will wiſh, that more of connection and dependency, (<hi>viz.</hi> of one Chapter upon another) had been made uſe
<pb facs="tcp:60264:6"/>of, than is in ſome part of this Treatiſe; but as to that, it is well known (if it be but as well conſidered) that books of this nature, <hi>viz.</hi> conſiſting of various Meditations and reflections, are uſually Miſcellaneous, and like books of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> in which little coherence is to be found (witneſs the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs of Solomon</hi>) which in the Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage are called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or Kingly ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, therefore haply becauſe each of them hath a kind of independent Juriſdiction, and territory to its ſelf; or we may compare both Proverbs and Meditations to Beads, which though many of them hang upon one and the ſame ſtring, yet each of them is incohering and intire of its ſelf.</p>
            <p>I fear leaſt ſome ſhould be offended (if not fore-warned) at my taking ſuch a liberty (and that but now and then) as did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he ſpake Ironically to <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.27. where the Text ſaith, <hi>Elijah</hi> mocked them and ſaid, <hi>Cry aloud, for he is a God, either he is talking, or he is purſuing, or he is in a journey, or he ſleepeth, and muſt be awaked.</hi> If this were no levity in that good Prophet, (as doubtleſs it was not) why ſhould it be counted ſo in others, when with like ſarcaſmes they reflect upon Idolaters (or worſhippers of
<pb facs="tcp:60264:7"/>graven Images) who ought to be cuttingly reproved (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>Laſtly, ſome it may be (if not preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) will cenſure me for prefixing more names than one, of my worthy and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red friends to this little book (at leaſtwiſe for ſo doing before each of the four parts and diviſions of it.) But I am conſcious to my ſelf that a grateful ſenſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and favours towards me (which is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually teſtified in ſuch a way as this, and which at preſent I knew not how to teſtifie to the world otherwiſe) was my great, if not onely inducement ſo to do; and if to be grateful be a fault, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, when <hi>Michal</hi> ſcoffed at him, <hi>he would be yet more vile;</hi> ſo give me leave to ſay, I muſt be grateful ſtill, and yet more grateful, if I knew how to be ſo: Onely miſtake me not, as if in ſo ſaying; I did threaten the world with another Book, for if I had reſolved to clog the Preſs, it is like I ſhould have reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to another opportunity ſeveral of theſe names which I have now inſerted (as it were <hi>in album amicorum.</hi>) If I have erred in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Dedications, it is not without preſident from that great maſter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,
<pb facs="tcp:60264:7"/>Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> (of precious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) whoſe practice (if I miſtake not) is ſufficient to authorize, at leaſt to excuſe in me a matter of this nature. <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou think there be here and there a paſſage that wants a grain or two of that ſadneſs which thou didſt deſire ſhould have been uſed upon this occaſion, do what thou wilt with it, provided only, that whereſoever thou doſt meet with convincing rebukes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions awakening to Repentance, with ſerious obſervations, with ſeaſonable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, with right methods for acquiring true happineſs and comfort (even under ſuch a ſtroke as this.)

                     <head>DISCOURSE I. <hi>Of the great duty of Conſidering in an evil time.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HE that would ſee my Commiſſion for engaging in the work of meditation at ſuch a time as this (in which few men know what to do, or ſay, or think) may read it in thoſe words of <hi>Salomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>But in the day of Adverſity conſider.</hi> Times of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary trouble, as they afford moſt matter to the Pen of an Hiſtorian, ſo likewiſe to the mind and heart of an obſerving Chriſtian. Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering in ſuch times, is called, not ſeeing the hand of God when it is lifted up, or refuſing to ſee it, (For the word tranſlated here conſider, is in the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> that is, ſee.) Now ſaith the Prophet, <hi>They will not ſee when thy hand is lifted up: but they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed, &amp;c. Yea th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> fire of thine enemies ſhall devour them. Iſa.</hi> 26.11. Wherefore is it that God doth call upon his people <hi>to enter into their chambers, ſhut their doors upon them, hide themſelves till the indignation be overpaſt, for the Lord commeth out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Iſa.</hi> 26.20. Is it not that men might then and there conſider what God hath done, and is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60264:15"/>doing? He can do little in his chamber, as a chriſtian (that might not be done elſewhere) that knows not how to meditate and pray there: nor can the latter be well performed without the former. Therefore the Pſalmiſt doth well joyn thoſe two together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.14. ſaying, <hi>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy ſight, O Lord.</hi> Sure I am, Affliction calls for a great deal of ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even to a degree of ſadneſs. <hi>James</hi> 5.1. <hi>Go to now you rich men, weep and houl for your miſeries which ſhall come upon you.</hi> And ſhould they not weep as much for thoſe that are come upon them already, and can no waies be prevented? Now great ſeriouſneſs there cannot be, where there is no muſing, and conſidering; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever conſidering is (ſuch as ought to be) there muſt needs be ſeriouſneſs. I ſhall think that man deſpiſeth the chaſtening of the Lord (which is ſtrictly forbidden <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5.) who is not thereby put upon conſidering ſuch things as are behoove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him, and ſuteable to the circumſtances under which he is. So much is hinted to us by theſe words, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.12. <hi>They regarded not the work of the Lord, neither conſider the operation of his hands.</hi> Methinks the puniſhment threatned in that caſe, ſeems to ſpeak that there is contempt of God in the ſin (ſaid I only threatned, yea executed.) For there is not only a woe to ſuch <hi>v.</hi> 11. but in the 13. verſe is added, <hi>Therefore my people are gone into captivity.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hell hath inlarged her ſelf, and their glory, and their multitude ſhall deſcend into it.</hi> Doubtleſs it is a great ſin in Gods account that procures ſo great a puniſhment. Who can perform the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60264:15"/>grand duties of an afflicted ſtate without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering? who muſt not of neceſſity conſider (and as the Poet calls it, <hi>in ſeſe deſcendere,</hi> go down into himſelf) if he will ſearch and try his wales, and turn to the Lord, as that afflicted Church is exhorted to do, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. But ſurely that proof is <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> which is more than the expreſs command in the firſt cited text, and in others parallel with it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.5. Thou ſhalt conſider, that as a man chaſteneth his ſon, ſo the Lord chaſteneth thee: where both the matter and manner of their chaſtiſement ſeemeth to be propoſed to their conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> that God had puniſhed them, and how. But I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced theſe proofs rather as motives to excite our wills and affections to ſo hard a work, than as arguments to prove ſo eaſie and manifeſt a truth.</p>
                     <p>If the queſtion be put, what are the things we ſhould conſider of in an evil day? it muſt here receive but a general anſwer, for to anſwer it particularly, and with reference to that ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing judgment by fire, which lately befell the great City, will be the drift and ſubſtance of all our enſuing Meditations and Diſcourſes? Yet I ſhall venture ſo far forth to prevent my ſelf, and anticipate what is behind, as to ſay, that it is our duty in an evil day to conſider, firſt, what may make for our own humiliation, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> the greatneſs of our own ſins. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Jeruſalem hath grievouſly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, therefore ſhe is removed.</hi> Alſo the greatneſs of the judgments of God that are upon us. (For as ſins, ſo judgments ought not to be extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.) <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>The puniſhment of the daughter of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60264:16"/>my people, is greater than the puniſhment of the ſin of Sodom, that was overthrown in a moment.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what may make for the vindication of God, as juſt and righteous in all that he hath done againſt us. To that purpoſe are the enſuing expreſſions of Scripture, <hi>Job</hi> 34.23. <hi>God will not lay upon man more than is right, that he ſhould enter into judgment with him. Pharaoh</hi> himſelf could ſay, <hi>The Lord is righteous, but I and my people are wicked.</hi> And this was when God rained down baile and fire upon him. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.27. and ſo ſaid <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> when <hi>Shiſhak</hi> came againſt him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.2. Shall ſuch as they juſtifie God, and ſhall not we? ſaying with the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, Lam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The Lord is righteous, for I have rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp;c.</hi> And as he elſewhere, <hi>Man for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his ſin.</hi> And then the cauſes of our Afflictions, thoſe we ſhould alſo conſider of, remembring that trouble ſprings not out of the duſt. We ſhould look at God as the efficient cauſe of all out miſeries. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.17. <hi>The Lord hath done that which he hath deviſed, he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied;</hi> and in that Chapter we finde the hand of God owned in every verſe for ten verſes together.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it leſs needful to conſider what are the meritorious and procuring cauſes of all our miſeries. So <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.42. <hi>We have tranſgreſſed and rebelled, thou haſt not pardoned.</hi> And <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Jeruſalem remembred not her laſt end, therefore ſhe came down wonderfully.</hi> Nor may we forget the final cauſe, or Gods primary end in ſending them (which is of all the reſt moſt comfortable to conſider.) So ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Iſraelites, <hi>Deut,</hi> 8.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt remember the way which the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60264:16"/>Lord thy God led thee, this forty years in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to humble thee, and to prove thee, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>But he chaſteneth us for our profit, that we might be made partakers of his holineſs.</hi> Again, we ought to conſider, what are the duties that are incumbent on us in a time of Adverſity; what is the Law, and the Decorum of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and how we ought to behave our ſelves under the rod of the Almighty, <hi>viz.</hi> Humbly, Patiently, Circumſpectly, &amp;c. of which we ſhall have occaſion to diſcourſe more fully hereafter. The next thing to be conſidered at ſuch a time, is, how and wherewithall we may be able to ſupport and bear up our own hearts, and the hearts of others in an evil day. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50. <hi>This is my comfort in my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, for thy word hath quickned me.</hi> Which may be thus conſtrued, that it was a comfort to him in his afflictions, to think that the Word of God had been a quickning and inlivening word to him, which to many others is but as a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. One end of Gods vouchſafing us his Word, is ſaid to be, <hi>that we through patience and comfort in the Scripture might have hope, Rom</hi> 15.4. and that we ſhould endeavour to comfort others, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. where God is ſaid, <hi>to comfort his people in all their tribulations, that they may be able to comfort others that are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith themſelves are comforted of God.</hi> One thing more I think of, that ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by us in a time of adverſity; but ſhall not preſume to ſay that and the reſt I have mentioned, are all; and that is, how and by what means we may in Gods way, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, in Gods due time obtain deliverance, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60264:17"/>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe cries out, <hi>who ſhall deliver?</hi> we read in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. that <hi>God will together with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape.</hi> How to finde out a way of eſcaping, is the care of all men, or of the moſt, but how to finde out that way which God hath made for our eſcape (which is alwaies a lawful and a regular way,) that ſhould fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our conſideration; as alſo how to avoid and ſhun all other waies of eſcaping, though ever ſo eaſie to us. Now have we ſo many things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of in an evil day? then O my ſoul here is work for thee, as much as ever thou canſt turn thy ſelf to; Gird up thy loines and ſet about it. Now if ever, is a time for ſerious conſideration, for who knows not that it is a time of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and rebuke, and needs it muſt, when the moſt famous City in theſe three Kingdoms (that was lately ſuch) is become a very ruinous heap, Now <hi>London,</hi> the glory of three renowned King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, is made almoſt like unto <hi>Sodom</hi> and to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah.</hi> Surely that man hath loſt his thinking faculty, that cannot think of this; and he that is not ſenſible of it, is paſt all feeling, and ſeared as with a hot Iron. O my ſoul, I ſcarce know what to think of thee, that thou haſt conſidered this no more: Much leſs know I what to think of thoſe that have not conſidered it ſo much, as ſeeming to think of nothing elſe, but how they may make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof. How many thought they could have ſaid when time was, If I forget thee O <hi>London,</hi> let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, which yet have almoſt forgotten poor <hi>London?</hi> and now God hath burned it round about, ſcarce lay it to their hearts. Methinks
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60264:17"/>we are in an age in which are more <hi>Pharaohs</hi> than of any other ſort of men; infinite wiſdome, can ſcarce invent judgments that will awaken and make us look about us, and conſider. The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron age is a name too good for us. Fire with the addition of ſome ſmall matter beſides, as vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, &amp;c. will melt Iron, but will not melt us, it will make that capable of any impreſſion, or to be caſt into any mould, but it will not do ſo by us.</p>
                     <p>Lord I ſee the heart of man will yield to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thy ſelf. It can play with judgments and plagues, though they were greater than thoſe which came upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and ſo far forth contemn them as ſcarce ſeriouſly to conſider of them, at leaſtwiſe when paſt and gone. Nor yet whilſt preſent, and incumbent as they ought to do. Thou who haſt created a day of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, ſuch as we never lookt for, create I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee in me, and in others, a heart duly to conſider it, and together with it, the things that do belong both to our preſent, and future, to our temporal and eternal peace.</p>

                        <p>THree ſeveral times do I call to mind the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, ſaying expreſly (beſides what it mentioneth elſewhere to the ſame effect) that our God is a conſuming Fire, twice in the old Teſtament, and once in the new. Firſt by way of caution, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leaſt you forget the Covenant of the Lord your God,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60264:18"/>which he hath made with you, and make you a graven Image, or the likeneſs of any thing, which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee. For the Lord thy God is a conſuming Fire, even a jealous God.</hi> Secondly, by way of comfort, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.3. <hi>The Lord thy God is he which goeth over before thee as a conſuming Fire,</hi> (meaning) to their enemies, as the next words do ſhow, he ſhall deſtroy them, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Anak,</hi> of whom they had learn'd to ſay who can ſtand before them? <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. them and their Cities great and fenced up to Heaven, as they are called, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Thirdly by way of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or poſitive exhortation unto ſerving God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. For ſaith the text, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. Our God <hi>is a conſuming Fire.</hi> And well may God be ſo ſtiled, not only <hi>effectivé,</hi> as he is the firſt cauſe and authour of all thoſe fires that conſume hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Towns, and Cities, as God is pleaſed to own, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.25. <hi>That he had ſet Jacob and Iſrael on fire round about,</hi> nor careth the great God who knowes, yea he would have all the World to know that all evil of puniſhment, as ſuch, and ſo far forth as it is only ſuch is from himſelf, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> But not only in that ſenſe may God be called a conſuming Fire, for that he is ſo <hi>eſſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter</hi> (as Chriſt upon ſuch, an accompt is called the reſurrection and the life) but alſo and chiefly becauſe the fire, of all Elements, yea of all inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures, ſeemes to bear the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of God, in reſpect of more than one of his glorious attributes, as namely of his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible power, his awfull preſence, and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Majeſty, his impartial and devouring ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, his conſuming anger, &amp;c.</p>

                        <head>Of the ſtrength and power of Fire.</head>
                        <p>What creature here below ſo powerfull as fire? who or what can ſtand before it? how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable unto fire are many of thoſe expreſſions, whereby God in his anſwer to <hi>Job,</hi> ſets forth ſome of the moſt untameable creatures, as that which is ſpoken of the wilde Aſs, <hi>Job</hi> 39.7. <hi>He ſcorneth the multitude of the City.</hi> Did not the fire do ſo? and that of God, concerning <hi>Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth, Job</hi> 41.4. <hi>Will he make a Covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a ſervant for ever?</hi> Who can maſter fire, though it be never good, but when it is as a ſervant? alſo in ſome ſenſe thoſe words in the 27. <hi>verſ.</hi> may be applied to this powerful Element. <hi>It eſteemeth Iron as ſtraw, and Braſs as rotten wood:</hi> alſo thoſe words in the laſt verſe, <hi>He beholdeth all high things, He is a King over all the children of pride.</hi> Methinks ſome lofty expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which are uſed concerning God himſelf, are more applicable to fire, than to any other creature. It is ſaid of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15. <hi>That he taketh up the Iſlands as a very little thing.</hi> So doth fire, though not whole Iſlands, yet things of great bulk, as houſes, Churches, and ſuch like, which are eaſily blown up by it, as it were at one breath or puff. It darts them up into the aire in an inſtant, like a fleete arrow ſhot from a ſtrong bow. Cranes though made on purpoſe to mount heavy things, yet are long in doing it, yea ſeem to ſqueek and groan in raiſing one great beam at a time, as if the burthen were more than they could well bear, whereas this Giant Fire, if I may ſo call it, makes nothing of it to take whole houſes upon its back, with all their weighty beames, maſſy ſtones, leaden roofes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60264:19"/>lumbering goods, and mount them into the aire preſently. Moreover it is ſaid of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>That Lebanon is not ſufficient for him to burn, nor the beaſts thereof, ſufficient for a burnt offering.</hi> Surely <hi>London</hi> was far before <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and yet when the moſt of it was burnt up, did the fire ſay it was enough? Could not that ravenous Lion have devoured the Suburbs preſently, with as great an appetite, as it had done the City, if the great God had not ſtopt its mouth, or pluckt away its prey?</p>
                        <p>Doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> rank fire amongſt the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants that are never ſatisfied, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.16. Who can write (or almoſt think) what Fire can do? what building ſo high, (be it beacon or ſteeple) that fire cannot preſently climbe to the top of it? What mettle ſo hard that fire cannot melt it, ſuch as the fire may be? It was only for haſt that it left the out-ſides of Churches ſtanding, pickt out the meat as it were, and left the bones untouched. In length of time it could have ſo calcined thoſe bricks and ſtones, as to have made them good for nothing, but ready like the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> preſently to crumble to duſt. But ſhould I think of all that fire can do, <hi>I</hi> muſt think of nothing elſe. <hi>I</hi> leſs wonder at thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that did worſhip fire, than at thoſe who worſhiped any other creature, ſith no viſible creature is ſo great an embleme, or ſo lively a picture of the power of God. Yet did they very ill to worſhip it, ſith the power of fire (though great) is but finite, and as much tranſcended by the power of God, as it ſelf tranſcends the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of other things.</p>

                        <p>If a little Fire, one ſingle Fire, taking its riſe, (it may be) but from a ſpark or two, can do ſuch great things, what cannot he do who made all the Fires in the World, and that of Tophet or Hell to boot! which is greater than all the reſt, <hi>the Pile whereof is much wood, and the breath of the Lord, like a mighty ſtreame of brimſtone kindleth it. Iſa.</hi> 30.33.

If it be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the power of God be far beyond that of all the fires in the World, who then can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his power to be incomparably great? and that it is ſo, we may plainly ſee, for that God ſuſpends the influence of fire at his pleaſure.

He can do more than fire, who can ſo limit fire its ſelf, that it can do juſt nothing. God forbid <hi>I</hi> ſhould adore fire, as the heathen did: but he that can do what he will by fire or without fire, yea againſt Fire it ſelf, he I ſay muſt needs be worthy of humbleſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and that in reference to his power.</p>

                        <p>Neither do we ſee in Fire a repreſentation of the power of God only, but alſo of his awfull and terrifying preſence. If we do but hear people crying out, either by day or night Fire, Fire, how doth it affright us, as if a potent enemy were at

(our eyes then affecting our hearts, and cauſing them even to ſink and die within us: how ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did men and women look? how diſtractedly did they run about! how did their haire even ſtand an end! how little did they know what they ſaid or did, whilſt with ſafety enough to their perſons they did at a ſufficient diſtance gaze at the Fire, conſuming their own and other mens houſes! had they themſelves been in their houſes at the ſame time, as at other times, they might have been, burnt in their Beds, ſome faſt aſleep, others but newly awake) the fire might poſſibly have had only dead Carcaſſes to conſume, as having been firſt killed by the greatneſs of their feares. Read <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21. where it is ſaid, <hi>ſo terrible was the ſight of Mount Sinai, that burned, verſ.</hi> 18, <hi>that Moſes ſaid; I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> (even that <hi>Moſes,</hi> that did not fear the wrath of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> could not without trembling ſtand and behold Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> all on fire. And yet what is it to ſee the moſt dreadful Fires, in compariſon of what it is to feel or live amidſt the ſmalleſt flames? To lie or think of lying one hour in a fiery Oven, were much more terrible, than to have ſtood at a diſtance and beheld <hi>Sodom</hi> or any other City all in flames.

But we know that kind of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment is due only to the worſt of men, becauſe the greateſt of earthly puniſhments, and the moſt like to hell. If Fire be not exceeding ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, why did the generality of men flie before it as faſt as they could, and leave all that was near it, to its mercy, or rather cruelty? yea it is commonly reported, that ſome of the ſtrongeſt and moſt undaunted bruits, as Wolves and Bears and Lions, are kept in awe by Fire, and dare not approach it. So that Fire is as it were a wall of defence to Men againſt thoſe ſalvage enemies. If the Lion roare, ſaith the Scripture, ſhall not all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iſa.</hi> 32.14. Who can dwell with devouring fire? were it but for the ſpace of a few moneths or daies, much more for many years together? (and in a ſmaller time, few of them ſeem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pech a releaſe from that place of torment; though they have advantages for that purpoſe above moſt other perſons.)

                        <p>Therefore O my ſoul, paſs on and think of ſomething elſe, in which the parallel holds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſuch Fire, as that whereby our famous City was lately burnt to aſhes, and God himſelf, who is ſtiled a conſuming Fire. Once again, As the power and awfull preſence of God are liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented to us by this material Fire: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is his anger, and that both as to the eſſence and nature of it; as alſo to ſeveral attributes (if I may ſo call them) of that attribute of God, <hi>viz.</hi> his wrath. As namely, the impartialneſs of it, like fire, that ſpareth neither one thing nor another: as alſo the fierceneſs of it, and its conſuming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying nature, to which might be added the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerableneſs of it, &amp;c. Firſt we know it is the nature and property of Fire to act, as if it were in a great paſſion, and yet it never is in any, nor is it capable of any. Thus ſaith God of himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Fury is not in me;</hi> that is, I am in no paſſion (neither can he be) yet adds, <hi>who will ſet the briars and thorns againſt me in battle? I would go thorough them, I would burn them together.</hi> Such things as are the uſual effects of anger are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done by God, but ſuch an affection as wrath in Man is, can no wayes conſiſt with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60264:22"/>thoſe perfections which are in God, no more than with the nature of fire upon other accounts.</p>
                        <p>I muſt not forget that I was even now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the impartiality of Fire, as one property of that Element by which it reſembleth God. Fire is no reſpecter of perſons or things: ſo their nature be but combuſtible, it ſpares neither one nor the other. May I not allude to thoſe words 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. <hi>If any Man build upon this foundation Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Wood, Hay, Stubble.</hi> Here are variety of ſuperſtructures mentioned; but the Fire buries all in one common heape; layes the gold and precious ſtones amongſt the rubbiſh, as well as the wood, hay, and ſtubble. It mingles Flint ſtones and Diamonds: Pibbles and Jewels in one and the ſame Grave.

                        <p>I obſerve another property in fire, and that is great fierceneſs and eagerneſs: ſo that for that matter there is no other creature comparable to it. A ſhee Bear robbed of her Whelps. A Bull in a Net, full of the ſury of the Lord, is not half ſo fierce as fire. I would ſee either of them two in an angry humour gnaw great beames of Iron in ſunder, and make them crumble to duſt: or let them but make ſome maſſy Oak beams pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fly in two, in token of their rage; but if they can do neither, fire exceedeth them in ſtrength and fierceneſs; but yet not ſo much as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60264:23"/>its ſelf is exceeded by the fierceneſs of the wrath of God; for whoſe wrath the Scripture hath no Epithite more common, than that of fierce, <hi>Num.</hi> 25.4, 32, 14. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.16. <hi>Thy fierce wrath goeth over me:</hi> and in the abſtract, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.49. <hi>He caſt upon them the fierceneſs of his anger:</hi> and <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Who can abide the fierceneſs of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi> The power and fierceneſs of fire may be conceived of, and we may fear as much or more hurt than the fire can have opportunity to dous; yea this time, many of us did fear it would have done more hurt: but the wrath of God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that our minds can comprehend. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath:</hi> The wrath of God is a vaſt Ocean, (as I may call it) his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are a great depth, and fire is but one ſtream of that Ocean: and therefore fire can be nothing like ſo fierce as is the wrath of God. Sword and Peſtilence are two other ſtreames of the wrath of God, and there are many more, by which you may judge how fierce the main Ocean is, every arm and rivulet whereof runs with ſuch a mighty torrent. In how many channels of diſtinct puniſhments did the wrath of God break out upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his people? and yet towards them he did not ſtir up all his wrath neither.</p>
                        <p>But the next property of the wrath of God, <hi>viz.</hi> its conſuming devouring nature (which fire may repreſent to us as much as any earthly thing) will plainly prove, that divine anger is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fierce. Which of all the creatures God hath made is ſo able to deſtroy, ſo profound to make ſlaughter as fire is? And is it not in that reſpect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60264:24"/>an Embleme of the wrath of God? What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſions are thoſe, <hi>Deutr.</hi> 32.22. <hi>A fire is kindled in mine anger, and ſhall burn unto the loweſt Hell, and ſhall conſume the Earth with her increaſe, and ſet on fire the foundations of the Mountains:</hi> alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.5. <hi>They are like the graſs which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up. In the morning it flouriſheth, in the evening it is cut down, and withered. For we are conſumed by thine anger.</hi> Alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.8. <hi>Come behold the works of the Lord, what Deſolations he hath made in the Earth.</hi> How doth the wrath of God conſume perſons, not only as to their eſtates, but as to their inward comforts, which are far more precious: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. <hi>When thou with rebukes doeſt correct man for iniquity, thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like a moth.</hi> Yea how the wrath of God conſumes Families. <hi>Job</hi> 31.12. <hi>It is a fire that conſumeth to deſtruction, and would root out all mine increaſe;</hi> Meaning that the wrath and curſe of God, which the ſin he there purgeth himſelf from, <hi>viz.</hi> Adultery, would procure that which would do ſo, that might root out all his increaſe both as to eſtate and off-ſpring, &amp;c. might quite conſume his Family. Of Gods wrath conſuming Towns and Cities, we have many ſad inſtances, as namely in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Sometimes the glory of the whole Earth. And a much more modern and ſad inſtance as to our ſelves in <hi>London</hi> its ſelf (with teares be it ſpoken) which none of us ever thought to have ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60264:24"/>deſtroyed by Fire? Theſe things conſidered, the conſumptions and deſolations which are made by Fire may juſtly put us in mind of thoſe greater deſolations which the wrath of God is able to make on perſons, families, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>

                        <p>There is one thing more in Fire, and that is the intolerableneſs of that pain and miſery which it is able to put us to, in reference to which I would yet further parallel it with the wrath of God.

I know no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alive ſo patient, as that he is able to bear it, if he be grievouſly burnt or ſcalded, till ſuch time as the fire be taken out; that is to ſay, bear it without doleful moans and outcries.</p>

                        <p>I think there is no man whoſe heart would ſerve him to think of lying in a ſiery ſurnace, ſuch as the three children were caſt into. Yet is not Fire its ſelf, got within us, or about us, ſo intolerable as the wrath of God. It goes by the name of <hi>Fiery indignation, Heb.</hi> 10 27. not as if it were no worſe than fire, but as fire being the moſt tormenting creature, we know can beſt expreſs it. It is the ſenſe of divine wrath that wounds the ſpirits of men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> that is, none can bear. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. I read <hi>Heman</hi> ſaying, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 88.4. <hi>I am ready to die from my youth up, whilſt I ſuffer thy terrors, I am diſtracted.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Thy terrors have cut me off.</hi> And <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 38. <hi>There is no reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſins.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>I have roared by reaſon of the diſquietneſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60264:25"/>of my heart,</hi> as being under a ſenſe of Gods wrath. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Rebuke me not in thy wrath.</hi> Whoſoever ſaid any thing may be borne but the wrath of God, doubtleſs meant very well; but he had ſpoken better, and paſt all exception, if he had ſaid, Any thing may be borne better than the wrath of God. There is no viall that ſcalds like to that. If <hi>Francis Spira</hi> whilſt deſpairing in his bed, had been burning at a ſtake inſtead thereof, I queſtion whether that material fire would have put him to ſo much miſery as did the anguiſh of his mind, overwhelmed with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of divine wrath, and of his future dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with everlaſting burnings. If hell its ſelf be a fire kindled by the breath of Gods wrath, as it is ſaid of <hi>Tophet, that the breath of the Lord like a mighty ſtream of Brimſtone kindleth it.</hi> Surely the wrath of God is much more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than any viſible, or culinary fire whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                        <p>I ſee then the Spirit of God, according to his manner, hath couched much ſenſe in a few words, when he tells us that our God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire. There being ſuch a likeneſs as is betwixt the Creator of all things and this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I deſire as oft as I behold fire, to think of God, whilſt I admire the ſcarcely reſiſtible po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Fire, let me ever adore the utterly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible power of him that made and governs it. Whilſt it amuſeth me to think what work and havock Fire can make in a few daies or hours. Be amazed, O my ſoul, to conſider what greater deſolations God can make in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye, and with a word of his mouth. If he will but ſpeak concerning a Nation, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60264:25"/>pluck it up, or pull it down, it will be done pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. with him it is but a word and a fatal blow. Methinks it doth not only help my meditation of, but facilitate my belief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the greatneſs of the power of God; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partialneſs of his revenging Juſtice: Severity and Fierceneſs of his anger: Intolerableneſs of his diſpleaſure: when I ſee ſo much of ſuch things as theſe in one of his creatures, which in our houſes we prefer to no better place than our chimneys, and are unwilling even there to place it, or ſuffer it to aſcend too high. May I think of Fire more frequently and ſolemnly than otherwiſe I ſhould, for thoſe reſemblances of God which are to be found in it. I confeſs, to think of God by the name of Love, as he is called, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8. &amp; 16. is more pleaſing, and may better ſuit us under great dejections, but to meditate of God as a conſuming fire, may profit us more, when our hearts (which is too uſual) want that due awe of God which ſhould preſerve them from ſinning wilfully againſt him. If God be Fire to ſinners, let us not dare to be as Tinder, or as Gun-powder to Sin and Temptation. If we come not neer a diſmal Fire but with trembling hearts, let us not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach God but with holy reverence, and let us learn to tremble at his word, which alſo is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to fire. Yet leſt I dwell too long upon this one ſubject to the prejudice of others, I will content my ſelf with the addition of a few plain Corollaries, ſo eaſie to be drawn from Gods being a conſuming Fire (in the ſenſe given of it) that he which runs may read them.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60264:27"/>did make way for the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> their being given up to Fornication. Pride prepares for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as it diſpoſeth perſons to thoſe habits and geſtures which tempt others to tempt them to wantonneſs: witneſs the great pride which ſome take in going extreamly naked, whence it often happens to them as to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> after that he had ſhown the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> meſſengers more of his treaſure than was fit for them to ſee. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. it was not long after that the Babylonians came and took away all he had from his children, and carried both them and theirs into captivity.

But that by the way.</p>
                        <p>It comes to paſs by the judgment of God, that proud perſons often prove unclean, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs is a diſgraceful ſin, and ſo the more fit for proud perſons to be left unto, in order to making them more humble. For of him that committeth Adultery <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.33. <hi>A wound and a diſhonour ſhall he get, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſhall not be wiped away.</hi> Perſons by that ſin are ſaid to <hi>diſhonour their own bodies. Rom.</hi> 1.24. Alſo that very complexion which is moſt ſamed for proud, is generally obſerved as moſt prone to uncleanneſs, and 'tis too commonly ſeen that a fantaſtical (which is a proud) habit, and a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy heart go together; and thoſe places are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally moſt notorious for luſt, that are moſt infamous for pride; as if thoſe two weeds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to grow in the ſame ſoil; proud ſpirits and proud fleſh go uſually hand in hand. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60264:27"/>as for Fulneſs of bread, by which we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Gluttony and Luxuriouſneſs in the uſe of meats, that is as great a hand-maid to Luſt as Pride can be. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7. <hi>When I fed them to the full, then they committed adultery, and aſſembled themſelves by troops in the harlots houſes. v.</hi> 8. <hi>They were as fed horſes in the morning, ever one neighed after his neighbours wife.</hi> (He adds <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord, and ſhall not my ſoul be avenged of ſuch a Nation as this?)

An idler people could not be, than many were in that great City, whereof themſelves would have been ſenſible, if they had but ſeen the pains and induſtry which is uſed by many or moſt people dwelling in Villages, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-places, that are alwaies in action, as the Poet ſaith of the Husbandman, <hi>Redit labor actus in orbem.</hi> And as for matter of uncleanneſs, why
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60264:29"/>was it that very Apprentices were ready to pull down houſes upon that account (though ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no commiſſion either from God or man; they did not well to attempt it) if Stews and Brothel-houſes had not been too notorious? As for not ſtrengthning the hand of the poor and needy, that is by a due relief, how could they otherwiſe chooſe than be guilty of it, who weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their eſtates by idleneſs, laviſhed them upon their pride, exhauſted them by their luxury, ſpent them upon their uncleanneſs, which as ſo many Cormorants devoured that which might and ought to have been given to the poor: I ſee then there are moral cauſes of evil as well as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and theſe are ſome of them. He is brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh that thinks otherwiſe. Do not the ends and intereſts of men ſway the World, next to God himſelf, and what are they but moral cauſes: and if ſuch be to be taken notice of, why not ſin, which is more conſiderable than all the reſt?</p>
                        <p>Then O yee late Inhabitants of that famous City, which is now in aſhes, as ever you deſire it ſhould flouriſh again, repent of your pride, fulneſs of bread, abundance of idleneſs, neglect of the poor, and abominable uncleanneſs, ſo many of you as were guilty of all, or any of theſe (for all were not;) and let others mourne over them that have ſinned, and have not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that God may repent of the evil which he hath brought upon you, and may build up your waſte places in his good time. Continue not in the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> leſt their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be either not removed from you, or if ſo, again revived upon you.</p>

                        <p>WE read concerning <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, that there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they died before the Lord? Lev.</hi> 10.2. Why that heavy judgment befell thoſe two Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> (the Saints of the Lord) the preceding verſe will tell us, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they took their cenſers, put incenſe therein, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſtrange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not. Their fault was this, God had ſent down fire from heaven upon his Altar, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9.24. It ſhould ſeem it was the pleaſure of God (and doubtleſs they knew it) that his ſacrifice (which one calls his meat, as the Altar his Table) ſhould be kindled and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with that fire only, which by continual add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuel, (as need required) was to be kept from ever going out, (as is ſuppoſed) <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.10. There 'tis ſaid, <hi>Aaron ſhall take a cenſer full of Coales of fire from off the Altar, and his hands full of incenſe, and bring it within the vaile.</hi> Now they preſumed to offer incenſe to God with common fire, which came not from the Altar, before the Lord, and for this they were burnt to death. Upon this paſſage Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> (worthily called our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seneca) reflects thus. It is a dangerous thing, ſaith he, in the ſervice of God to decline from his own inſtitutions; we have to do with a power, which is wiſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his own worſhip, juſt to require what he hath preſcribed, powerful to revenge that which he hath not required.</p>

Our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment I am ſure hath been by fire as well as theirs; ought we not then to examine whether cur provocation was not much-what by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, even as theirs was? were we contented when the City was ſtanding? yea did we not grumble and repine at one thing or other every day? and yet we think we ſhould be more than contented, that is to ſay, very thankfull and joyfull, if we had but <hi>London</hi> again, if that great City Phenix-like might but riſe out of the aſhes, and our places know us once more. It ſhould

The Robbers and ſpoilers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in fault. Yet ſeeing it was God that gave <hi>Jacob</hi> to the ſpoile, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the robbers, that was reaſon enough why they ſhould be dumb as a ſheep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Shearer, and not open their mouths in any way of murmuring.

If in our hearts we quarrel with God, as if he were a hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and had done us wrong, if when we had food and raiment we were not content; if when we had ſomething, and that conſiderable (and how could our loſs have been conſiderable, if our enjoyment had not been ſo?) we were as unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as if we had juſt nothing.

                        <p>THe <hi>ſixteenth</hi> Chapter of the Book called <hi>Numbers,</hi> in the 35 verſe thereof, tells us, how that <hi>a Fire came down from the Lord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed no leſs then</hi> 250 <hi>Men that offered Incenſe,</hi> not their Houſes, but their very Perſons. Some would hardly think that ſo ſmall a crime (as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Magiſtracy and Miniſtry are in their account) ſhould have been the only cauſes of ſo heavy a judgment. And yet we finde that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as the main, if not the only reaſon of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Complices being conſumed by fire. The Confederates of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> are ſaid to have been 250 Princes of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, famous in the Congregation, men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown.

But to pretend they would have none inferiour to them, ſurely was but a ſtratagem to bring to paſs that they might have no Superiors, or rather that themſelves might be ſuperiour to all others. This was like to come to good, they would have neither head nor taile in Church or State, or elſe it ſhould be all head, or all taile. But from theſe principles of Anarchy and Ataxy ſet at work (I ſay) from the diſpleaſure of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them upon that account) ſprang the fire which we there read of.</p>
                        <p>Much of this ſpirit hath been in <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few years paſt, when not a few gloried in the name of Levellers, at leaſtwiſe in the character and principles of men ſo called. If any of thoſe embers be ſtill raked up under aſhes, I ſhould fear leaſt a Fire of tumult and confuſion might break out from thence, and by their meanes as ſoon as any way: nor do I queſtion at all, but that the ſin and guilt of ſuch vile and antiſcriptural te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets might help to kindle that fire which lately devoured the City. God will not ſuffer two ſuch great Ordinances, as Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, which ſo greatly concern the good of the World, nor either of them to be trampled upon. St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks ſharply of ſuch men, calling them filthy dreamers, who deſpiſe dominion: and ſpeak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of dignities: they who would level theſe, the God of order will level them, for ſuch are

                        <p>TO them that ſhall carefully read what is ſpoken, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.28. nothing will more plainly appear than that God hath ſometimes contended by Fire, for the pollution and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Sabbaths which he hath bid us
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60264:35"/>remember to keep holy. The words are theſe, <hi>But if you will not hearken to me, to hallow the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and not to bear a burden even entring at the gates of Jeruſalem on the Sabbath-day: then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it ſhall devour the Pallaces of Jeruſalem, and it ſhall not be quenched.</hi> To this ſin amongſt others did <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> owe its deſtruction by Fire, which was afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. It is one of the complaints which the Prophet makes, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.6. <hi>that God had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their ſolemn Feaſts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion.</hi> They would not keep them when they might, and afterwards (ſuch was their diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and confuſion) they could hardly keep them if they would, and had ſo diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the obſervation of them, that they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgotten that they had ſometimes enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch good daies, and ſtill ought to obſerve them. It is ſaid in <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.7. <hi>that the enemies ſaw her,</hi> viz. <hi>Jeruſalem, and did mock at her Sabbaths;</hi> which ſome expound, of their deriding the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of their wonted publick and ſolemn ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, which the Temple being demoliſhed they were forced to intermit.</p>
                        <p>I wiſh there lay no guilt upon <hi>England,</hi> and upon <hi>London</hi> its ſelf, in reference to the profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Gods Sabbaths, and forgetting to keep them holy, as we are commanded to do; when <hi>Saul</hi> told <hi>Samuel, that he had performed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Samuel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>What meaneth then this bleating of the ſheep in mine eares, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</hi> Alluding to that, I may anſwer ſuch as ſhall pretend the Sabbath was ſtrictly kept; what then was the meaning of that poiſe of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60264:36"/>children and young folks, that we ſaw and heard playing up and down the ſtreets on the Lords day? or what meant that vain and idle communication that we heard from the mouths of young and old, both men and women, as we paſſed along the ſtreets on thoſe daies? how came the Fields adjacent to the City, to be ſo crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with company, walking to and fro, meerly for their pleaſure on the Lords day; yea, why was it thus, not only before and after the time of publick worſhip, but in the very ſeaſon of it? in ſo much that there was more company ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the fields, on the Lords day, than in the Churches? was it for want of Churches to repair to? how could that be, when there were ſo many within the City it ſelf, that now the Fire hath deſtroyed above fourſcore, yet ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main? It could not be for want of room in Churches, for many were almoſt empty, and ſome of thoſe, in which I doubt not, but the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of Gods Word might have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Why were Taverns and Ale-houſes that ſtood in the fields, ſo frequented on the Lords daies, more than on working daies, as if they had been the Churches, and <hi>Bacchus</hi> the God that men ought to worſhip? yea, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently ſuſpected, that Stewes and Baudy-houſes were not without their cuſtomers on that day, as well as on any others. Oh the wanton carriages that mine eyes have ſeen on that day in the open fields. The greateſt part of thoſe I met, ſeemed to be on the merry pin, laughing &amp; jeſting, and diſporting themſelves one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both young men and maidens: By their behaviour one would have took it for ſome
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60264:36"/>jovial time, rather than for a day holy to the Lord, in which men are enjoyned, <hi>not to think their own thoughts, ſpeak their own words, or finde their own pleaſures.</hi> How few have I heard ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the name of God into their months on that day, otherwiſe than in vain, and by curſed oaths, as I have walked ſome miles an end. I verily think that many people had wont to ſpend the Lords day worſe, generally, than any day in the whole week. Many did ſpend other daies in honeſt labour, who miſ-ſpent the Lords day in diſhoneſt recreations. So far were moſt from preparing for it before it came, that few kept it holy when it was come. Jews will not omit the preparations to their Sabbaths, but Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did not only ſo, but pollute the Lords day its ſelf. I might ſpeak of ſuch as did take the boldneſs to work on the Lords day, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they read to the contrary in <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.21. and expreſly in the fourth Commandement, in which it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.10. <hi>In it thou ſhalt not do any work, thou nor thy ſervant:</hi> and yet did not ſome hard maſters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act all their labours of their ſervants on thoſe daies, when they had haſt of work.</p>
                        <p>Have we not others ſet their wits on work to diſpute againſt that day, and to write againſt it; witneſs many ill Treatiſes extant to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And why might they not as well have written againſt the other nine Commandements as againſt the fourth? Why muſt that only be thought Ceremonial, when all the reſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be Morral? If God have ſeemed to change it from the laſt to the firſt day of the Week, can we take a juſt occaſion from thence to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60264:37"/>abrogate it? I doubt not but the day we now keep by the name of the Lords day, was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſecond Commandement as well as that which they under the Old Teſtament kept, which was called the Sabbath. A ſeventh day, or one day in every ſeven is provided for by that Commandment to be kept holy, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the ſeventh day from the creation. For it is not ſaid, that God bleſſed the ſeventh day and hallowed it; but that he bleſſed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, or that day which himſelf had or ſhould appoint to be kept as a Sabbath, or time of holy reſt; which under the Old Teſtament was the laſt, but under the New is the firſt day of the week, called the Lords day, for that Chriſt roſe again as on that day. Although the firſt adminiſtration of the Lords Supper was in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavenned bread, yet the inſtitution of it is for the uſe of bread, not of that which is unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So, though God reſted on the ſeventh day from the Creation, yet his legal Ordinance doth not preciſely require the obſervation of that day, but of one day in ſeven. Who doubts but baptiſme and the Lords Supper are now as much in force by vertue of the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as Circumciſion &amp; the Paſſover were of old; that Commandment referring to ſuch Ordinances as God ſhould appoint, as well as to thoſe which he had appointed, and ſo the fourth Commandement, to any day in ſeven that God ſhould enjoyn, as well as to that which he had enjoyned. Why ſhould not the practice of the Apoſtles be a ſufficient warrant for chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the day? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. On the firſt day of the week let every of you lay by him in ſtore
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60264:37"/>as God hath proſpered him. It appeareth that was their day of meeting for worſhip, becauſe on that day they made their Collections for the poor; and in <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. it is ſaid, <hi>that on the firſt day of the week when the diſciples met to break bread, Paul preached to them;</hi> intimating, that was their day for partaking of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and therefore in all likelihood for other religious ſervices. Now, would the Apoſtles have ventured to change the day, without leave and command from God ſo to do?</p>
                        <p>But if any man be not convinced by theſe arguments, that the day ought to be ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; yet let him ſhew me the leaſt colour of reaſon for abrogating of the fourth Commandment, and obſerving no day in the week as a Sabbath to the Lord. Moſt men, if they muſt keep one day in the week holy, had as lieve it ſhould be the firſt day of the week as the laſt. Moſt of thoſe that quarrel at the obſervation of the firſt day, or Chriſtian Sabbath, I fear do it becauſe they would obſerve none at all; but as for thoſe that conſcientiouſly obſerve a ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. I dare not call them Jews, for Judaizing in that one thing, but think they may be better Chriſtians than many that are more Orthodox as to the Time and Day. But as for thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane perſons that have and do refuſe to dedicate either the laſt or firſt day of the week to God, as a Sabbath or holy reſt, I muſt be bold to tell them (if they be Engliſh-men) they had a great hand in ſetting <hi>London</hi> on fire, which was a vaſt loſs to the whole Nation, and came doubtleſs for the ſins of the whole Nation, as well as for the ſins of its inhabitants. I ſay,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60264:38"/>you had a great hand in it, and particularly by your prophanation of the Lords day, as the Text I quoted from <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.21. leads me to think. I had almoſt ſaid, that was become a National ſin, as by the general practice of it, ſo for want of due endeavours to reſtrain it, ſuch as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> uſed, (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.16.) and therefore no wonder if God have puniſhed with that which was, is, and will be a ſore ſtroke upon the body of the Nation.</p>
                        <p>But beſides the groſs prophanation of the Lords day, whereof wicked men were guilty, <hi>viz.</hi> by working, playing, and doing more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs then, than at other times. I fear few of the better ſort can waſh their hands in innocency, as from finding their own pleaſure, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their own words on Gods holy day, which is forbidden, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. or have called the Sabbath their delight, holy, and honourable of the Lord, as became us. Or with <hi>John</hi> have been in the Spirit, ſo as we ought, on the Lords day. Few of us have kept any one Sabbath, as a Sabbath ſhould be kept. Under pretence that we fear to act like Jews; it is well if we forget not to act like Chriſtians, as to the Lords day. We took Gods day from him, and now he hath taken our City from us; we robd him of the beſt day in the week, for all daies are his, but this more eſpecially; &amp; he hath deprived us of the beſt City in the three Kingdoms. We committed Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in robbing God of his daies, which he had ſet apart for himſelf, and it proſpered with us no better than that Coale did which the Eagle ſtole from the Altar, and therewith fired her own Neſt. And now poor <hi>London,</hi> (if I may ſtill call
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60264:38"/>thee <hi>London</hi>) thou enjoyeſt thy Sabbaths in that doleful ſenſe, as was threatned, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.34. <hi>Then ſhall the Land enjoy its Sabbaths, as long as it lieth deſolate.</hi> And the ſame reaſon may be given now as then, <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>As long as it lieth deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it ſhall reſt, becauſe it did not reſt in your Sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>I Dolatry is plainly and properly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, to be the worſhipping of a falſe God (one or more) or elſe of the true God in a falſe manner. The former is expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the firſt Commandment, which is in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me;</hi> but the latter in the ſecond, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Thou ſhalt not worſhip, or pretend to worſhip me in the uſe of Images, or of any thing elſe which I my ſelf have not inſtituted and appointed. Now whereas ſome may think that the worſhipping of graven Images, for Gods, or as if they were Gods themſelves, and not the worſhipping of the true God, in the uſe of them, is the ſin forbidden in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor worſhip them.</hi> The contrary is evident enough. For the worſhipping of any other beſides the true God, is that which the firſt Commandment doth directly forbid, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60264:39"/>is the ſum and ſubſtance of it; now we muſt not make the firſt and ſecond Commandments one and the ſame. Therefore the ſin forbidden in the ſecond Commandment is the worſhipping of God, in or by the uſe of Images, and other things which he never appointed, as means, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and parts of his worſhip. Now this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter branch of Idolatry is the ſame thing with that which is called Superſtition; which is as much as <hi>ſupra ſtatutum,</hi> or a being devout and religious, or rather ſeeming to be ſo, above what is written, or was ever commanded by God. Of the firſt ſort of Idolatry which conſiſts in profeſſedly worſhipping any other beſides the true God, I ſhall need to ſay nothing; becauſe that is the Idolatry of Heathen only, &amp; all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians profeſs to abhor it. But alas, how many calling themſelves Chriſtians, are not aſhamed to own and defend their worſhipping of Images relatively, (as they term it) though not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, mediately, though not ultimately. But if we can prove that this was all that many did, whom God was pleaſed to charge with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to puniſh grievouſly, even with Fire, for ſo doing; that will be to the point in hand. See for this <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.31. <hi>I will make your Cities, waſte, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now in what caſe doth God threaten ſo to do, <hi>viz.</hi> in caſe they ſhould offer to ſet up any Images, to bow down to them. <hi>v.</hi> 1. and ſhould not repent of their ſo doing after they had been warned by leſſer judgments: <hi>If ſo,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I will make your Cities waſte:</hi> and ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60264:39"/>he did by Fire, for that very ſin. Now the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thus threatned were the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who had ſo much knowledge of the true God, that it was impoſſible for them to think that thoſe ſtocks and ſtones which they did bow to, were God himſelf; but only they made them as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations and memorials of God (or little Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for God to repair to, if he pleaſed; or as ſures to draw God to them (as one calleth them) and yet for this, they are charged with Idolatry; for thoſe very Images are called <hi>their Idols, v.</hi> 1. <hi>Ye ſhall make ye no Idols, or graven I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages;</hi> and by the greatneſs of that puniſhment which God inflicted for the ſame, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he reckoned it as Idolatrie, for it was that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, that they intended no more by their Images, than only pictures and reſemblances of God, is intimated to us by thoſe words, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, for ye ſaw no manner of Similitude, on the day that the Lord ſpake unto you in Horeb, out of the midſt of the Fire. v.</hi> 16. <hi>Leſt you make you an Image, the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of any figure.</hi> As if he had ſaid, that God did therefore forbear at that time to aſſume any viſible ſhape, becauſe he would not have any repreſentations made of him, which to doe were Idolatrie; at leaſtwiſe, if done in order to religious worſhip.

Could any of them ſo far renounce reaſon, and common ſenſe (leaſt of all could <hi>Aaron</hi> do ſo) as to think that Image brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was no Image till after their comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which had not been what it was, but that they made a Calf of it? which they knew, of its ſelf was neither able to do good nor evil. No ſurely, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to ſet up that only as a memorial of God, and to worſhip God in and by it. For this <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo angry with them, and with the puppet which they had made, that as we read <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>He took the Calf, burnt it in the fire, ground it to powder, and ſtrewed it upon the water, and made them drink of it.</hi> The Apoſtle calls them Idolaters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Neither be ye Idolaters, as were ſome of them;</hi> which is quoted out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6. If there were no Idolatry in the Golden-calf ſo intended, why was <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo angry with it? yea, why was God ſo angry with them, as by <hi>Moſes</hi> to give charge to the ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> to ſlay every man his brother, and his companion, and his neighbour? <hi>v.</hi> 27. and all for their ſin in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that Golden-calf? and in <hi>v.</hi> 10. ſaid God to <hi>Moſes, Let me alone that my wrath may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them.</hi> By which we may plainly ſee, that the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie I have been ſpeaking of, which is againſt the ſecond Commandment kindleth fires, as well as that which is againſt the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Therefore a Caveat is entred againſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven images, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.23. upon the account of Gods being a conſuming fire, and a jealous God; a fire that can burn, and full of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie (which is the rage of God as well as of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60264:40"/>man) ſo that he will not ſpare in the day of his anger.</p>
                        <p>Now if any ſhould think it harſh to call that which is intended as the worſhip of the true God, by the name of worſhipping Idols, when Idols are made uſe of only as memorials of God, and helps to worſhip; let them conſider, that if ſuch worſhip any thing really and truly, it is the Idol that is before them: for it muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that, or God; it is not God they worſhip, for he accepts it no more than if they had <hi>cut off a dogs neck, or offered ſwines blood, Iſa.</hi> 66.3. See <hi>Acts</hi> 7.43. <hi>O ye houſe of Iſrael, have ye offered to me ſlain beaſts, and ſacrifices by the ſpace of forty years? yea, ye took up the Tabernacle of Moleck.</hi> He denies they offered to him, becauſe they corrupted his worſhip, and ſo in effect he was not worſhipped at all. <hi>Amot</hi> 5.25. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Sring no more vain Oblations.</hi> Therefore ſuch perſons doing that which God accounts now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to himſelf, are ſaid to worſhip the Idol they pretend to worſhip by; and ſo to bleſs an Idol. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The things which the Gentiles ſacrificed, they ſacrificed to devils, not to God;</hi> not that they intended their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for the ſervice of devils; leaſt of all, when they offered their ſons and daughters. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.37. Yet becauſe it was a ſacrifice acceptable to the devil, and abominable to God, it is ſaid, that <hi>they ſacrificed their ſons and their daughters to devils.</hi> That is, to the <hi>Idols of Canaan,</hi> which they took for their Gods, and not for devils, <hi>v.</hi> 38. But moreover,</p>
                        <p>God puniſhed worſhipping by Idols, as if it were worſhipping of Idols: becauſe the former
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60264:41"/>leads to the latter; and will introduce it in time, and preſently too, amongſt a great many. Many that are taught to worſhip before Images, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſtinguiſh of doing it Relatively not Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, mediately, and not ultimately; and ſo they do it abſolutely and not relatively, ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately and not mediately. Idols are brought in by the help of diſtinctions, but when once brought in, the diſtinctions are forgotten, and the Idols only are remembred, and the more ignorant ſort of people will turn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heathens, that is, worſhippers of ſtocks and ſtones. The jealous God fore-ſeeing this, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all uſe of Images in and about his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſeeing that kind of dalliance and kiſſing the calves, will end at laſt in going a whoring from him, by ſuch Idolatrie as was amongſt the blindeſt Heathens. Now God would prevent the in-lets of evil, and therefore he would not permit the Nazarites ſo much as to eat the ſtones of Grapes, leſt it ſhould bring them by degrees to drink Wine, which they had vowed againſt; ſo neither will he ſuffer men to worſhip by, or in the uſe of Images, leſt they come at laſt to worſhip Images themſelves. And to the end the worſhip of God might be kept pure, care is taken in the ſecond Commandment, that men ſhould preſent God with nothing as either <hi>medium,</hi> or <hi>pars cultus,</hi> but what himſelf hath preſcribed; for by the ſame reaſon that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping by Graven-images is forbidden, are we prohibited the uſe of every other thing, as any means or part of divine worſhip which G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as for thoſe <hi>Galathians</hi> that did obſerve daies, and moneths, and times, and years, the Apoſtle ſaith plainly, <hi>he was afraid he had beſtowed upon them labour in vain;</hi> namely, becauſe they thought to pleaſe, and to worſhip God, in and by thoſe things which were never of his own appointment. I wiſh then that whoſoever ſhall read this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may become convinced, if not ſo before, how greatly the ſins of Idolattie and ſuperſtition do provoke God, and kindle the fire of his wrath. <hi>Saul</hi> gave <hi>Samuel</hi> a ſuperſtitious reaſon, why the people took of the Sheep and Oxen, the chief of the things which ſhould have been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroied; namely, that it was to ſacrifice to the Lord in <hi>Gilgal.</hi> Yet this their devotion, beſides, and contrarie to Gods command, is called <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and ſaid to be <hi>as the ſin of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft:</hi> and as for Idolatrie, if Idolaters do in Gods account ſacrifice to devils: how juſt is it for Idolatrie to be reckoned as the ſin of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. Witches are burnt by the Laws of our Land. Now if that which God

Now Lord, if thoſe men whoſe Religion teacheth them to inſiſt upon their merits, and if others have meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo, to flie to their works of ſupererogation, (as their manner is to idolize themſelves, and their own works) if ſuch ſhall attempt to break in upon us like a flood, grant that thy Spirit pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out upon our Rulers, may lift up its ſelf as a ſtandard againſt them.</p>

The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Land have uſed oppreſſion, and have

Foraſmuch then as your treading is upon the poor, and ye have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him burthens of wheat, yee have built houſes of hewen ſtone, but ye ſhall not dwell in them, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And then for <hi>Theft,</hi> ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.29. The people of the Land have exerciſed robbery: and <hi>Zechary</hi> 5.4. The curſe ſhall enter into the houſe of the thief, and ſhall conſume it, with the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, and with the ſtones thereof.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, as for deceit and falſe ballances, ſee <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. Hear yee this, that ſay, when will the Sabbath be over, that we may ſet forth wheat, making the <hi>Ephah</hi> ſmall, and the <hi>Shekell</hi> great, that we may falſify the ballances by deceit? Take notice that the judgments denounced againſt that people, are generally thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, I will ſend a fire, &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.2. Now one cauſe was their deceit and falſe ballances.</p>
                        <p>Now were not the ſins forementioned too too common in the Land, and in the great City which is now ruined? Did not many rich men oppreſs the poor by griping uſury, extorting, brokage, taking unmerciful forfeitures of pawns, and pledges, by ingroſſing of commodities, and ſelling them at unreaſonable rates, by vexatious ſuites, by taking them at advantages, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their neceſſities, by with-holding thoſe debts and dues which poor men had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to recover, and ſeveral other wayes? For I pretend not to know the one half of that myſtery of iniquity. Did not rich Lawayers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60264:43"/>their poor Clients, rich Phyſicians their poor Patients, rich Landlords their poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, raiſing and racking their rents? Did they not grinde the faces of the poor, as it were to powder? and when time ſerved, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly when the fire was, did not the poor ſhew, their hearts ſerved them to oppreſs the rich? If theft did not abound, why were ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned almoſt every Monethly Seſſions upon that account? (beſides many that eſcaped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered) how came it to paſs, that there was a formal ſociety and corporation of theeves, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kind of order and government amongſt themſelves? Then as for deceit and falſe ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I doubt thoſe things were more common than either of the two former; though they might juſtly bear the name of either, <hi>viz.</hi> of deceit or theft, though they went not common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the name of either. How much bad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was knowingly put off, braſs pieces, light gold, and ſuch like? how many unſerviceable wares were vended at dear rates? how many rich commodities were ſophiſticated, as Wines, Phyſical Drugs, and the like, to the great hazard, of Mens health and lives? What traſh was ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Pearl, and Beazar, and for other high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed things? All was lookt upon as cleer gaines by many, in which they could but over-reach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though the Scripture ſaith, let no Man defraud his brother, for God is an avenger of all ſuch things. If a Man had not his wits about him, he could go into few places, and not be cheated, whatſoever he bought, if he did not underſtand it himſelf: ſo that it grew a proverb, that Men knew not who to truſt. Men would
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60264:43"/>ask twice as much as they could take, and yet would have taken all they did ask, if the buyer would have given it. As for falſe ballances, let the Queſts that went about, ſpeak what ill weights they found in many places, heavier to buy by, and lighter to ſell by. Let the full Baskets of Bread which were given away almoſt every Market-day, becauſe too light to be ſold, beare witneſs. Why was ſo much butter and bread taken from the owners, and ſent to the Priſons, but for want of due weight? If men did uſe falſe ballances in ſo cheap Commodities, and that were to come under the teſt, what did they not do in thoſe that were dearer, &amp; they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left to their own conſciences? in things as to which one dram of weight more or leſs would turn to more profit than many loaves of bread, or pounds of butter?</p>
                        <p>I doubt not but there were thoſe, and not a few, that would not have wronged a cuſtomer in one grain of weight for the greateſt profit: but were not the generality of Tradeſmen for all they could get, <hi>Per fas, ant nefas,</hi> that is, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Reflecting upon the great deceit and cheating there was: I wonder not that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſtands, whilſt <hi>London</hi> lies in aſhes: For if we may believe travellers, amongſt the very <hi>Turks</hi> there was more common juſtice, that is, righteouſneſs and freedome from deceit in buying and ſelling, than amongſt us. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art thou O Lord, yet let me plead with thee concerning thy judgments, why were their ſhops and houſes burnt down that uſed no deceit? (and there were many ſuch) but as for others, thy juſtice doth moſt manifeſtly appear in ſcourge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60264:44"/>thoſe buyers and ſellers out of houſe and home, by a fiery Rod, who turned the famous City (which ſhould have been a Mountain of righteouſneſs and juſtice) into a Den of theeves and robbers.</p>

The fire ſhall devour thy bars, &amp;c. now one cauſe he gives of that wo, was lying, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Wee to the City, it is full of lies and robbery.</hi> Fitly are thoſe two put together, for probably many or moſt of the lies they had wont to tell, were in a way of trade, in order to unjuſt gain, which is no other than robbery in Gods account. Oh that <hi>London,</hi> in this reſpect, had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Nineveh,</hi> for the multitude of lies that were daily told in many parts of it, in order to robbery, that is, undue gain: A good man would not have told ſo many wilful lyes, for a whole World, as ſome would tell, to get a few ſhillings, if not pence. This coſt me ſo much, ſaith one, and by and by he ſells it for leſs than he ſaid it coſt him, (which few men will do) you ſhall have the very beſt, ſaith another, and yet if he have any worſe than other, puts him off with that. I had ſo much for the very fellow of this, had ſome wont to ſay, when there was no ſuch matter. This is as good as can be bought for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60264:44"/>money, would ſome ſay, when yet they knew that it was ſtark naught, could ſuch pretend themſelves to be the people of God? who ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.8. <hi>They are my people, Children that will not lie, ſo I was their Saviour.</hi> Could men thus abound with lies, and yet believe what is written. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>All lyars ſhall have their portion in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone:</hi> No wonder if that which kindles Hell it ſelf, did help to fire a City.</p>
                        <p>But to paſs on to the ſin of Swearing, either falſly or vainly, both of which were too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the great City, till the very time of its deſtruction by fire, (though poſſibly as common or more in ſome other place.) Was it conſidered at leaſtwiſe, it is now time to conſider what is ſpoken, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.4. <hi>The curſe ſhall enter into the Houſe of him that ſweareth falſly by my Name, and ſhall conſume it, with the timber and ſtones thereof.</hi> How was the Land over-run with perjury? What if few cauſes were tried, in which there was not oathes againſt oathes, men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſwearing point blank one againſt another? Both could not be true: <hi>Contradictoria non poſſent eſſe ſimul vera.</hi> How ordinary was it with men to ſwear, what was impoſſible for them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? How have oathes been bought and ſold? were there not thoſe that made a trade of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (Knights of the Poſt men called them) they would pleaſure any man with an oath, that would but pay them for it. How many have preſumed, they could carry almoſt any Cauſe, defend any title, how bad ſoever, by a pack of ſwearers, which were ready to ſerve them upon all occaſions? As long as they could have oathes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60264:45"/>for their money, they feared nothing. <hi>England</hi> hath driven a mighty trade in oathes, forward and backward, and made them ſo common, that with many men, they are grown contemptible, and they have learnt to play with them, as is ſaid of ſome, that they uſe <hi>Ludere Juramentis ut pueri teſſeris.</hi> Alas, how many made nothing of it, to ſwear a hundred oathes, they would do this or that; as namely, they would pay ſuch a debt by ſuch a time, and yet never mean to do it? O <hi>England,</hi> if thou hadſt no ſin but this, it were no marvel that this Metropolis ſhould now lye in the duſt. For ſuch oathes as theſe doth the great City (that was) yea and the whole Land ſuffering with it, mourn at this day. Though ſome have expoſed themſelves to temporal ruine, for fear of oathes, yet have not others deſperately ſaid, they would not be undone by refuſing oathes of what kind ſoever? they would truſt God with their ſoules, and not men with their eſtates. If this ſin were not as oile to the late flames, I know not what was. It is no whit ſtrange that falſe ſwearing ſhould be puniſhed with temporal fire, when meer lying or falſe ſpeaking is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with that fire which is eternal. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8.</p>
                        <p>But then, as for vain ſwearing, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was it; as if men had never heard of the third Commandment, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for he will not hold them guiltleſs.</hi> Vain Oaths ſlew about like ſo much Musket-ſhot, when two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are in fight, ſo that they ſtruck every man (his cars at leaſtwiſe) that went along the ſtreets. Who that heard the needleſs Oaths men had wont to ſwear, could but think of <hi>Davids</hi> words?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60264:45"/>
                           <hi>Be not merciful to any that tranſgreſs without a cauſe.</hi> I am confident there were ſome that took a great pride in ſwearing, and thought it a great piece of Gentility to abound in Oathes, though many Tinkers and Tapſters could ſwear as faſt as they: but could they have had the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of ſwearing to themſelves, and a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition upon all poor men to ſwear, as wel as they, would they not have accounted it a very great honour and priviledge? Thus did they glory in their ſhame. Unleſs they vaunted themſelves, in ſhewing how bold they did dare to make with God, I ſee not why they ſhould be proud of their vain ſwearing. What wit was there in rapping out an oath? Or what fool could not utter as many oathes as they? who was ſo ſilly as to honour them for their ſwearing? Or who did the rather believe them for it? yea who did not infer, that, becauſe they would ſwear without cauſe, they would alſo lie? How did men bid a daily defiance to that text that ſaith? Above all things ſwear not? and practiſe, as if St. <hi>James</hi> had ſaid, my brethren, above all things ſwear. When <hi>London</hi> was become as full of oathes, (as the aire is of motes) (which ſpake the tongues of men to be ſet on fire of hell) no wonder that there came a flying roll filled vvith a curſe, vvhich conſumed the timber thereof, and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the ſtones thereof. <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.4. May then the horrid ſins of lying, ſvvearing, and forſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be buried as it vvere in <hi>London</hi>'s ruines, ſo as never to riſe up more; and may the late Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſame mourne, as it vvere in duſt and aſhes, for thoſe great provocations, and if ever <hi>London</hi> be its ſelf again, may he paſs for a

Woe unto us that thoſe ſins ſhould now be clad in ſcarlet, which formerly did no more than imbrace dunghils, which were in uſe amongſt few, but thoſe mean and ſordid perſons that did well become a Cage, or Stocks, or Whipping-poſt, the juſt reward of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60264:47"/>which as Magiſtrates is their due. Drunkenneſs did ſo abound amongſt all ſorts, that I perſwade my ſelf, more good liquors were ſacrificed to Mens luſts, than were ſpent upon their neceſſities.

If an enemy were at hand ready to cut our throats, they have neither heads to adviſe, nor legges to ſtand upon, nor hands to fight, were it to ſave their own lives, who have all of theſe when they are themſelves.

I had thought here to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the good fellowes, (as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) but a ſtrange fancy came in my head, and it was this, that if your great drunkards were able to retain all they receive, and to give it out as good as they took it in, a few of them might be able to furniſh a well-cuſtom'd Vintner with as much Wine of ſeveral ſorts, as would ſerve him a good while for his occaſions, and each of them (upon one years collection) (O monſters of men) might contain and yield more than the greateſt

He is an unprofitable Magiſtcate, that is neither a terror to evil doers, nor an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them that do well; but much more, if <hi>vice verſâ,</hi> he doth worſe than bear the ſword in vain. He is an unprofitable Miniſter, that neither inſtructs the people by wholſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor by a holy life; that wants both <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that doth not calculate his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for the good of ſouls; that either ſhoots over peoples heads, by too much profundity and oſtentation of Learning, ſuch as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, or ſhoots under their feet, by ſuch weak and ſenſleſs diſcourſes as make both his perſon and doctrine contemptible. He that treats his people, as if Non-ſenſe were the only Nectar and Ambroſia for immortal people to feed upon, (as one phraſeth it.) In a word, he that ſtudies only to provoke his ſoules by medling with what he ſhould not; or only to pleaſe them, by not medling with what he ſhould: and laſtly, he that fleeceth the flock, but feeds it not, is an unprofitable Miniſter, if he may ſo much as be called a Miniſter.

                        <p>To be uſeleſs out of neceſſity, is but a mans miſery; but to be ſo out of choice, is a very

Such as are ſpoken of <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Whoſe riches are corrupted, and their garments are moth-eaten; their gold and ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them is a witneſs againſt them.</hi> But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch who are ſo far from being merciful, notwithſtanding their great eſtates, that they cannot finde in their hearts to be juſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Behold the hire of the labourers, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth.</hi> God hath ſent them great crops, and they thought much to pay poor men for reaping of them. <hi>The cries of them which have reaped, are entred into the ears of the Lord God of Sabbaoth;</hi> that is, of Hoſts; who is pleaſed ſometimes to fall upon ſuch miſers in a hoſtile way, even by Fire and Sword, and ſnatch that from them, which they would not voluntarily part with to any good uſes. Moreover, he is an unprofitable member of a Town, County, or Kingdom, that only ſeeks great things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and cares not what becomes of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick weale: whereas we ſee that things without life, as Aire and Water, and ſuch like, will forſake their own centers, and vary from their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60264:50"/>natural motion, to comply with the good of the Univerſe, by preventing a <hi>vacuum.</hi> But worſe than unprofitable are they, who as our Proverb ſpeaks, Do ſet other mens houſes on fire to roſt their own egges; that is, do others the greateſt miſchief, to do themſelves a ſmall courteſie. Laſtly, he is an unprofitable member of the world, who lives meerly to eat and drink, and riſe up to play. The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the widdow who liveth in pleaſure, is dead whilſt ſhe liveth. Seneca</hi> would ſay, ſuch men might be ſaid to be (or have a being) but not to live. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have no calling, nor know how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to any, but to be ſervants to divers luſts and pleaſures, to read Romances and Play-books, and wanton Poems, to run about to Play-houſes, to court Ladies, to talk idly to women, that love ſuch diſcourſe; to paſs the time in Cards, and Dice, and Wine, and Jeſts, when the weather conſtrains them to be within doors; and at other times in Hunting and Hawking, and Fiſhing, and ſuch-like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements. Of ſuch voluptuoſoes (if I may ſo call them) we read, <hi>Job</hi> 22.12. <hi>They take the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ. They ſpend their daies in mirth, &amp;c. and in a moment go down to the grave.</hi> As they ſay, it is a Proverb amongſt thieves, A merry life, and a ſhort life. For many ſuch perſons do ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their daies by their exceſs, as to Wine and Women, and ride poſt out of the world upon the back of thoſe head-ſtrong luſts which run away with them. The perſons I have deſcribed are paſt all queſtion uſeleſs, and meer cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds; like dead trees, fit for nothing but to burn.</p>

Sin had made a great part of the inhabitants, as much dry wood in one ſenſe, as want of rain had made their houſes ſuch. I marvel not then that ſo great a Fire approaching ſuch prepared fewel both within and without, did ſo much execution, but rather that it did no more. May the iſſue of that diſmal Fire which was lately amongſt us be the ſame that husbandmen effect or deſign in burning their Lands, <hi>viz.</hi> that we, as they, which before were barren and unprofitable, may become uſeful and fruitful, which Lord grant for Chriſt his ſake.</p>

                        <p>I Need not go far from that Text on which I grafted the next preceding meditation; To finde another that will plainly prove the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60264:51"/>corruption and degeneration of a people, to have as it were inforced God, though he be ſlow to anger, and rich in mercy, to contend with them by Fire, yea and conſume them. The ſame Prophet furniſheth me with a large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in that kind, too large to tranſcribe; and therefore I ſhall rehearſe but part of it, and refer to the reſt. For it reacheth from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.19. to the end of the 31 verſe. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, becauſe ye are all become droſs, therefore I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you into the midst of Jeruſalem, v.</hi> 20. <hi>as ſilver into the midſt of a furnace, and I will leave you there, and melt you. v.</hi> 22. <hi>And ye ſhall know that I the Lord have poured out my fury upon you.</hi> That they were all become Droſs, ſignifies no more but this, that they were univerſally depraved and debauched, as appeareth plainly by that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment which is given in againſt their Prieſts and Prophets, and Princes, and common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that is, againſt perſons of all ranks and conditions, in the ſequel of the Chapter. The like charge there is to be found, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.27. <hi>For every one is an hypocrite, and an evil doer, and every mouth ſpeaketh folly. v.</hi> 14. <hi>Therefore the Lord will cut off from Iſrael head and tail, branch and ruſh in one day. v.</hi> 18. <hi>For wickedneſs burneth as the fire, it ſhall devour the briars and the thorns.</hi> That is, the wicked amongſt them, the beſt of which was as a briar, or as a thorny hedg. It is ſad to conſider, that there have been certain times in which no ſort of men have kept themſelves pure and unſpotted, but all have defiled their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which the fire of ſin hath ſpread as much more than in other ages, as the late Fire upon <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſpread it ſelf beyond all the Fires that City
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60264:52"/>had known formerly. Some time before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the old world by water, it is ſaid, that <hi>All fleſh had corrupted his way, Gen.</hi> 6.11. and when God was about to rain Fire and Brimſtone upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> not ten righteous perſons could be found to ſtand in the gap. And a ſtrange chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it is which God makes, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Run through the ſtreets of Jeruſalem, and ſee now and know if ye can finde a man, if there be any that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth judgment, and ſeeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.</hi> Is it ſo with us at this day, or is it not? Are we univerſally corrupt and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and debauched, or are we not? Have all ſorts of men corrupted their waies, and done abominably, or have they not? Poſſibly in this our <hi>Sardis</hi> there are ſome few names that have not defiled their garments: but alas, how few are they? and what are ſo few names to the generality and body of a Nation? Are thoſe words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> applicable to us or not? <hi>There is no ſoundneſs, but wounds and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores, from the ſole of the foot, even to the head, Iſa.</hi> 1.7. and then followeth, <hi>your Country is deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, your Cities are burnt with Fire.</hi> Might I take leave to be particular, I would ſay, that City, and Countrey, and Court, and Inns of Court, and Univerſities, all have exceedingly corrupted their waies; what a corruption in judgment hath over-ſpread us? ſome turning to Socinianiſm, others to Popery, others to Atheiſm, yea great (and Leviathan-like) Atheiſm?</p>
                        <p>How great a corruption is there at this day in the habits, gates, and geſtures of men and women, which I would not trouble my ſelf to ſpeak of; but that as little a thing as it may
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60264:52"/>ſeem, it is a ſymptome of great evil within; for many times the habits of the mind are ſignified by thoſe of the body. A proud habit and a proud heart, a wanton habit, and a wanton heart, do often, if not alwaies meet. For what modeſt woman would put on the attire of an harlot? or, who cares to make ſhew of more evil than is really in them; and not rather to conceale that which is? A modeſt habit is not ſo ſure a ſign of a chaſte heart (for that may be worn for a cloak of diſ-honeſty) as an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt habit is of one that is unchaſte. For what wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It may ſeem a ſmall matter for ſick people to play with feathers, and to make babies with their ſheets; but it is an uſual fore-runner, and conſequently a ſign of death. So the habits of men and women, when they carry with them a great appearance of Pride, Levity, Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Inconſiſtency of mind, Prodigality, Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtickneſs, Inconſtancy, do give great jealouſie to wiſe men, (who can diſcern much light ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through ſmall crevices) that the Age, or rather perſons of this Age, do abound with ſuch kind of vices, and that there is ſome kind of Fatallity belonging to it, becauſe people uſe ſuch antick poſtures and geſtures, as dying perſons are wont to uſe. I wiſh the fore-mentioned vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had get no neerer men than their skins, that they were but skin-deep, but as the Itch and ſuch like diſeaſes are firſt within, and then ſtrike out, firſt inſect the maſs of blood, and not till af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60264:53"/>blood a ſecond time; ſo it is to be feared, that men and women are generally proud and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in heart, before they are ſo in habit; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo in habit, becauſe they were firſt ſo in heart. Now if the hearts of many be ſuch, as their moſt fantaſtick and gariſh habits make ſhow of; thoſe words of <hi>Solomon: Eccleſ.</hi> 9.3. Muſt needs be verified in them, <hi>The heart of the Sons of Men is full of evil, &amp; madneſs is in their heart whilſt they live, &amp;c.</hi> Yet for all this, I would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe charity concerning the habits of men and women (though that be hard to do) did not the common practiſe, and courſe of this Age aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me that it is univerſally corrupt and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and as it were, expound the meaning of ſuch ſuſpicious habits.</p>
                        <p>It is no difficult thing to prove the ſins of this Age, becauſe men now adayes declare their ſins like <hi>Sodom,</hi> and do as it were, ſpread a Tent in the face of the Sun, as did <hi>Abſalom.</hi> I am much miſtaken (and ſo are many more) if the groſs ſins of ſwearing, curſing, Sabbath breaking, drunkenneſs, whoredome, together with too great a connivance at, and impunity to theſe and ſome others, be not more chargable upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at this day, than they had wont to be. Are not theſe the things which male-contents do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to juſtify their murmurings, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they, or can they be thereby juſtified, as I have plainly ſhewed in that Chapter, in which I have diſcourſed of Rebellion againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> We muſt keep our ſtations and do our duties, though other men ſhould refuſe to do theirs. If a Wiſe play the harlot, may her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in requital commit adultery? no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60264:53"/>This premiſed, I may the more boldly ſay, whatſoever the matter is, and whence ſo ever it comes, a very general corruption there is amongſt us. What is ſaid of the ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is <hi>Tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte,</hi> wholly in the whole body, and wholly in every part, may be applied to ſin, as if it were become the very ſoul that did animate and inform the Nation.

                        <p>So that you ſee the judgment of fire came as it were to avenge the quarrel of other abuſed judgments, when Famine and Peſtilence had done no good upon them, then God uſed Fire, which as being the worſt, was reſerved to the laſt.

                        <p>Now <hi>England</hi> hold up thy hand at the Bar, and anſwer, Art thou guilty or not guilty of the great ſin of incorrigibleneſs? and you diſperſed inhabitants of that once famous City, which now lieth in the duſt (little did I ever think to have called you by that name) ſpeak out and ſay, were you guilty or not guilty of much incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibleneſs under other judgments, before ſuch time as God began to contend with you by that Fire which hath now almoſt conſumed you? Plead your innocency if you can: Either prove you were never warned, or ſufficiently warned by preceding judgments, or make it appear that you took warning, and mended upon it. That war by Sea, which hath been as a bloody iſſue upon the Nation for ſeveral yeares paſt, and is not yet ſtanched, was that no warning piece? That impoveriſhing decay of trade which hath made ſo many murmur, was it no warning to us to repent and reform? If it were a great judgment, did it not call upon us to reform, and if but a ſmall one, why did we ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at it? That devouring peſtilence which in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60264:55"/>one years time ſwept away above a hundred thouſand in and about <hi>London,</hi> was it not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warning to us from heaven? Yet after all this, how few did ſmite upon their thighs, and ſaid, what have I done? I doubt few have been the better for all theſe, and many the worſe, who ſince God hath ſo ſmitten us, have revolted more and more, which is ſuch a thing, as if <hi>Jonah</hi> ſhould have preſumed to provoke God more than ever, even then when he was in the great deep, and in the Whales belly; or <hi>Daniel</hi> whilſt he was in the Lions Den, or the three Children in the midſt of the fiery Furnace: I wiſh ſome of our greateſt ſins had not been committed in the time of our greateſt dangers, as is ſpoken to the ſhame of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they provoked God at the Sea, even at the red Sea. God having threatned that if great judgments do not reform a people, he will ſend yet greater; it is no wonder that it is with <hi>London</hi> as it is, but rather, that the execution of this puniſhment was defer'd ſo long. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods heating his Furnace ſeven times hotter for a people, when a more gentle Fire hath not conſumed their droſs, we read <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.24. <hi>If yee will not be reformed by theſe things, I will pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh you yet ſeven times for your ſins.</hi> Alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 18.21, 24, 28. <hi>I will bring ſeven times more Plagues upon you, according to your ſins.</hi> How juſtly may God complain of us, as he did of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in old time. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction, they have made their faces harder than a Rock, they have refuſed to return.</hi> God hath made us <hi>as a boiling Pot, but our ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

We have cauſe to admire that God hath not in wrath ceaſed to puniſh us at the preſent, intending to reſerve us to the day of judgment, and of the perdition of ungodly men to be puniſhed. It is one of the greateſt puniſhments, for God in wrath to give over puniſhing, and to ſay as concerning <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, He is joyned to Idols, let him alone,</hi> or why <hi>ſhould they be ſmitten any more, they will revolt more and more.</hi> It would kill the heart of an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding patient; when very ill, to hear his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſay, let him have what he will, and do what he will, for then would he conclude, he takes his condition to be deſperate, and hath no hope of his recovery.</p>
                        <p>O Lord, ſith thou art pleaſed to condeſcend ſo far, as yet to choſten us (For what is man that thou ſhouldſt magnify him? that thou ſhouldſt viſit him every morning, and try him every moment? <hi>Job</hi> 7.18.) intimating thereby, that thou haſt not utterly caſt us off, but art in a way of reclaiming us; be pleaſed to bleſs and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe thy chaſtiſements, and do us good by them, as we would do by our Children, if we knew how, or if it were in our power. Thou
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60264:56"/>canſt make leſs correction if thou ſo pleaſe to work a greater reformation in us. One twig of thy rod, and one laſh of that twig, being ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, will do us more good than a Scorpion that is not. Suffer us no longer by our incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibleneſs under judgments, to add contempt and contumacy to all our other ſins, which is able to ſwell a ſmall crime into a hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

                        </head>
                        <p>O <hi>London,</hi> how were thy ſins out of meaſure ſinful? Conſider thy ſins without their ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, and I doubt not but there were many places in <hi>England</hi> (proportionably to their bigneſs) more wicked than <hi>London</hi> was; particularly, many Sea-towns, and ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, moſt conſiſting of Innes and Ale-houſes. But how few of thoſe places that equallized or poſſibly exceeded <hi>London</hi> in wickedneſs, did ever come neer it as in reference to means of grace, and other mercies? I have heard of a Papiſt,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60264:56"/>who in a ſtorm did vow in caſe he were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he would give to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> a 'Taper no leſs than the Main-maſt of the Ship he was in; but when the ſtorm was over, perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deouſly ſaid, that he would make a Farthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candle ſerve her turn. Were not the means thou didſt enjoy like the Taper he promiſed, whilſt thoſe which other places enjoyed, were but like the Candle which he performed? Some wicked Towns have been like <hi>Aegypt</hi> for darkneſs, whilſt <hi>London</hi> was like <hi>Goſhen</hi> for light.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capernaum</hi> it ſelf was not more truly lifted up to Heaven in the abundance of means, than <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> had been. For gifts and knowledge, thou wert another Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Had the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things which have been done in thee, been done in other places, who knows how they might have proved? To be ſure thou haſt had line upon line, precept upon precept, here a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and there a little. In thee an excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon might have been heard every day of the week, and oft times more than one in a day. The men that inhabited thee any long time, for their time might have been all of them teachers, though all did not profit accordingly. They could not but know their maſters will if they cared to know it; and therefore if they did it not, were worthy of many ſtripes. I am loath to ſay what courſe fare the ſouls of men had in other places, and what ſhort commons, whilſt thou wert fed to the full. Thou hadſt Quailes, whilſt they had ſcarcely Mannah. Thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſpake like the Oracles of God, whilſt ſome of theirs could hardly ſpeak ſenſe. <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60264:57"/>
                           <hi>Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> were yours, whilſt amongſt them the blind lead the blind, and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if both fall into the ditch. O <hi>London,</hi> it is impoſſible thou ſhouldſt ſin ſo cheap as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places might do, conſidering thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin: but now they have no cloak for their ſin.</hi> Had thy ſins been but motes, there was that ſun-ſhine would have made them all to appear; but alas, how many of them were beams? I know not thoſe ſins that were found elſe-where, that were not to be found in the midſt of thee. Though thou hadſt the Prophets of God crying to thee early and late, O do not this abominable thing which my ſoul hateth.</p>
                        <p>Some body ſpake long ſince by way of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or aggravation rather; what! go to hell out of <hi>London; England</hi> is preſumed to have more knowledge in the things of God, than any other part of the world, and <hi>London</hi> than moſt part of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither did thy means of grace (O <hi>London</hi>) more exceed thoſe of other parts, than thy other mercies did. Hadſt thou not the beſt of every thing? the beſt houſes, the beſt trades, the beſt commodities, the beſt proviſions, the beſt Phyſicians, Apothecaries, Chirurgeons, Artiſts, and Artificers in every kind? the beſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations of all ſorts. Whilſt the poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were put off with any thing; the very cream of all things was brought to thy hands. Had Farmers wont to live like you Citizens? they drudged, and toiled, lived meanly, fared hardlie, habited themſelves in poor and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60264:57"/>apparrel, contented themſelves with any thing: whilſt you dwelt at caſe and in pomp, fed high, went gallantly, followed the faſhions, vied with the Court it ſelf. So were you provided for, as if all <hi>England,</hi> yea, as if all the remote parts of the world, as far as both the Indies, had been made for no other end, than to ſerve and ſupply <hi>London;</hi> and their ſheaf, like that of <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, to bow to your ſheaf. What did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>London</hi> ſerve the Countrey with, or the Countrey ſerve its ſelfe with, but as I may ſay, the very leavings and refuſe of the City? As the ſpleen and meſentery, and other more ignoble parts are fed with the courſeſt kind of blood, which nature will not offer to the heart and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; ſo was the Countrey with thoſe mean things which the City did little leſs than diſdain. Yea had not <hi>London,</hi> amongſt other priviledges, greater variety of good company than other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had good Chriſtians, ingenious men in all profeſſions, inſomuch that ſome could no more frame themſelves to live out of <hi>London,</hi> than Fiſh can, to live out of the water.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things conſidered, <hi>London</hi> proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to its priviledges, ſhould have been the beſt place in the whole world. But was it ſo? It is hard, comparing the ſins of one place with another, but ſure I am, the ſins of <hi>London</hi> were many, and great; all its priviledges notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Wonder not then (O <hi>London</hi>) that God hath ſet thee on fire, whilſt other places are yet ſpared: Wert thou as good as other places? (poſſibly ſo) but thou ſhouldeſt have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than they, for the means and mercies thou haſt enjoyed far above them. Yea wert thou bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60264:58"/>than ſome other places? (that may be too) but wert thou ſo much better, as thou were happier than they? did thy goodneſs towards God exceed theirs, as much as his goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, exceeded his goodneſs towards them? Who knows not that to whom much is given, from them much is expected? If they made four talents of two, was it not more than if thou didſt make ſeven talents of five? O Lord, thou haſt ſeverely chaſtened this great City, cauſe all that are concerned to know, there is a juſt reaſon for what thou haſt done. That place haſt thou known above all other places and haſt not dealt ſo with any people almoſt, as thou haſt dealt with the inhabitants thereof, therefore haſt thou puniſhed them for their iniquity. Thou ſpeakeſt of tribulation upon the Jew firſt (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that had the greateſt priviledges) and afterwards upon the Gentiles: ſo thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with <hi>London</hi> firſt, it being but equal they ſhould firſt drink of the cup of miſery, who have drunk deep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </head>
                     <p>IT much increaſeth my wonder at the great things done by Fire, when I ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Fire is, I had almoſt ſaid what a petty thing it is. I could ſcarce believe it at the firſt, but am now convinced, paſt all doubt, that Fire is nothing but a mighty ſwarm, and corrent of ſulphurious particles, or motes of brimſtone, violently agitated or moved, and forcibly break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from thoſe reſpective bodies, to which they did formerly belong.</p>
                     <p>That Fire is a meer ſtream of ſmall particles, motes, or atomes, methinks the ſtrange vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo much of every thing, as did turn to Fire, as it were into aire or ſmoke, (or we know not what our ſelves) doth prove ſufficiently. Though there be ſome remainder of all or moſt things that are burnt, (as namely aſhes, &amp;c.) yet a great part of each body ſo deſtroyed is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60264:61"/>miſſing, flies away imperceptibly, (that is, we ſee nothing of what it was before) and we can but gueſs (at moſt) what is become of it. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of bulk and weight, and yet not very much neither, though they may aſcend for the preſent upon the wings of others, as bars of Iron blown up with Gun-powder, yet down they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and having got rid of that mantle, either of ſmoke or fire, in which they mounted up, come under our view again; ſo do the ſalt and Earthy parts of moſt bodies, which we call by the name of aſhes. What ſmall things are aſhes! and yet too heavy alwaies to keep aloft, &amp; preſſed down to the Earth with that little weight they have, which is next to none: (take them ſinglely and one by one) Surely then thoſe flaming bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which keep their ſtation above, and never return to us again, (as we can diſcern) which fly up to the Element of Fire, (if ſuch a notion may be admitted) and there abide, (as Rivers run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea) they muſt be exceeding light, and weightleſs, and conſequently as exile, and ſmall, as can be imagined. For matter (as Fire doubtleſs is) cannot but be ponderous, if there be any quantity of it together. Were ſeveral motes, ſuch as we ſee in the aire joyned together, they could not flote and ſwim as they do, in that thin vehicle, but would quickly ſink to the ground, much leſs were they able to fly up to heaven, (as if they had Eagles wings) as we obſerve fire to do.</p>
                     <p>Sith then it is clear to us, that Fire is nothing elſe but a mighty ſtream of atomes (which we ſhall prove anon to be ſulphurious) O my ſoul, apply this ere thou proceed any further. Surely
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60264:61"/>this notion hath its uſe. I ſee the great God can terrify the World, yea and deſtroy it too, with any thing, yea with that which is next to nothing. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. <hi>But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire, againſt the day of judgment, verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>The Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo and the workes that are therein, ſhall be burnt up.</hi> I ceaſe to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at God his making Locuſts, yea flies, yea lice, ſo great a Plague to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf began to relent, whilſt thoſe Plagues were upon him. Thoſe Creatures were Giants (if I may ſo ſpeak) in compariſon of thoſe motes of brimſtone, which the great God imployed to deſtroy our City, and ſhall be his only Executioners at laſt in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole World, as I proved but now. How many parts do belong to each flie, or flea? (For even all their parts were down in Gods Book) head, eyes, eares, legs, intrails, and now each of theſe parts (and for ought I know, count bones, and all, they may be ſome ſcores of them) are I preſume as big or bigger than any one of thoſe ſulphurious Atomes, or Motes of which Fire conſiſts. A man would ſcarce believe till he had well conſidered it, that ſwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dreadful expreſſions, yet were all verified in an Army of Locuſts, and ſuch like deſpicable inſects, by which God did ſuch execution upon them, as did demonſtrate thoſe expreſſions, not to have been ſo ſtrange as true, yea to have been no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolies. <hi>Joel</hi> 1.4.</p>
                     <p>Now, how eaſie is it for us to believe this might be ſo, who have ſeen the great God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wonderfull deſolations by far weaker in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> by an army of little motes of brimſtone, all in an uproare, and joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, to take their flight from thoſe bodies, in, and with which they lately dwelt in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable peace, and Amity. <hi>Goliah</hi> in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not more exceed <hi>David</hi> in ſtrength and ſtature, and dimenſions every way, than Locuſts, and ſuch like inſects do exceed thoſe little Atomes, whereof Fire conſiſts. Beſides thoſe Inſects, are living creatures (which is a great matter) but the ſulphurious particles I am ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of (otherwiſe called fire) are (as we all know) things without life, and yet ſo nimble when God ſets them on, as if they had vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſouls to actuate them; or rather, as if they themſelves were all ſoul, and ſpirit, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome of the contemptibleſt ſhreds, or rather ſilings of meer matter. I ſee then that the great God can make a formidable Army of any thing, (even of the duſt of the earth, for why not of that, as well as of theſe?) I have therefore done
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60264:62"/>wondring that ſuch things ſhould be ſpoken of Locuſts, and ſuch like inſects as are in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.11. <hi>The Lord ſhall utter his voice before his Army, for his Camp is very great.</hi> The words that follow in the ſame verſe, are a ſufficient Comment, <hi>For he is ſtrong that executeth his word.</hi> surely they do their work in his ſtrength, whoſe glory it is to make weak things confound the mighty, and things that are not, bring to naught things that are.</p>
                     <p>I further learn from hence, the great danger of an enraged multitude, though every one of that number fingly, and by himſelf conſidered, be very mean and deſpicable: yet all put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may be terrible as an Army with Banners. The Pſalmiſt ſeems to ſpeak of the tumult of the people, as if it were ſo hard to ſtill and pacifie, as the very raging of the Sea. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.7. <hi>Which ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the noiſe of the ſeas, and the tumults of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Multitudes of people are compared to great Waters, or Inundations, and they as well as Fire it ſelf (though each ſingle perſon is but as one poor drop) will bear down all before them. It is God-like to ſtill the Tumults of the people; but to raiſe tempeſts and commotions amongſt them, as <hi>Jonas</hi> did upon the Sea, is neither the part of a Chriſtian, nor of a wiſe man? Who would conjure up thoſe ſpirits which poſſibly he ſhall never be able to lay again? Oh the ſtrength of weak things united and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by whole millions together! oh the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of little things met in ſuch infinite ſwarms; what vaſt things are the Sands of the Sea-ſhore, take them together? What huge mountains do they make? and how do they give Law to the Sea its ſelf, and ſay to it under God, hitherto
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60264:63"/>ſhalt thou go and no further? <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Fear ye not me, ſaith the Lord, which have placed the ſands for the bounds of the Sea, that it cannot paſs it, and though the waves thereof toſs themſelves, yet can they not prevaile; though they roar, yet can they not paſs over.</hi> Yea, what ſmaller and more deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable thing, than each of thoſe by its ſelf conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? They have more paſſion than pollicy that ſtick not to inrage the body of a Nation, without a juſt and enforcing cauſe, though to humour them in every thing (any more than children) is not commendable, or convenient. What goodly ſhips have ſtuck faſt in thoſe heaps of duſt, called ſands? ſo as they could never get off again, yea been ſwallowed up by them? as <hi>Jonas</hi> was by the Whale, or <hi>Corah</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices by the earth, when it opened its mouth upon them? ſo that no diſcreet pilot ventures to come neer them, or offers to ſay what hurt can ſo ſtrong and ſtately a veſſel, receive from thoſe ſands, which are but a heap of duſt, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of which run thorough a little pin-hole in an hour-glaſs in the ſpace of one hour? If an Ocean of Atomes did (as we know to our coſt) bring greater and ſpeedier ruine, on our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City than an hoaſt of men could have done (for that they much exceeded any army in number, though their power ſingly were next to nothing.) If ſo, I ſay, it appeareth, that vaſt and innumerable multitudes (at leaſtwiſe of people) though of the weaker and more deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſort, ought not to be bad in contempt, or to be needleſly put into a combuſtion. Alas, were it not that God had put a divine ſtamp upon Magiſtrates (as he hath been pleaſed to call
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60264:63"/>them Gods) ſurely they could no more rule the people, when in the calmeſt temper that ever they are in (ſome being alwaies too rough) then they could rule the Sea. What wiſdom can it then be to put ſo unruly a body into aground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs commotion? If this Sea once become trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, work, and rage, and foam, and ſwell, how much is it to be feared it may overflow all its banks, and invade us with a ruining inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It was not cowardize, but prudence in <hi>Herod,</hi> to decline putting of <hi>John</hi> to death, for fear of the people, becauſe they accounted him a Prophet, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.15. Likewiſe in the chief Prieſts and Elders of the people, not to reply unto Chriſt, that the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was of men, becauſe of the people, who all held him as a Prophet, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.26. For my own part, I dread, the Inſurrection of people, no leſs than the conſequences of Fire it ſelf, the beginnings whereof have appeared very contemptible, ſo that it hath been ſaid, (as is reported) that ſuch a fire as that was at the firſt, might be piſſed out; but the concluſion fatal, beyond all imagination.</p>
                     <p>Now do I long to be at the end of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but having promiſed to ſhew what the matter of thoſe particles is whereof Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, and conſidering with my ſelf that ſome good morall may be gathered and infer'd from thence, as I have already hinted, that ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or oily particles are thoſe whereof Fire doth altogether or moſtly conſiſt: ſo I ſhall now undertake to prove that ſo it is, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how we may improve it. It is manifeſt that all mixt bodies here below are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of five Elements, or principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirit,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60264:64"/>(otherwiſe called <hi>Mercury</hi>) Water, (or Phlegme) Sulphur, (or an Oily kind of ſubſtance) Salt and Earth. For each natural body, be it of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitables Animals, or Minerals, is by chymical art reduced or reſolved into theſe five. From any ſuch bodie may be drawn a ſpirit, or generous ſubtile liquor; an Oile, a Water, a Salt, and a kind of Earth; ſaving that the two laſt are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid to ſtay behind, than to be drawn. now if each body that is burning, be as it is, both its own fire and its own fuell, both that which burns and that which is burnt, then one or more of the fore-mentioned principles ſo modified, muſt be the matter and form of fire. As for the Watery and Phlegmatick part of each body, no man will ſo confound two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements ſo contrary each to other, as to ſay that is the Fire which conſumes. Then as for that Salt and Earth which belongs to bodies, they are not the Fire that burns them up, for that which burns ſo far forth conſumes and flies away, but Salt and Earth they remain after the greateſt burnings, under the form of Aſhes. True it is, that ſpirit or ſpiritous Liquor which is in Bodies, is capable of taking Fire; as we ſee ſpirit of Wine will burn, and Feavers ariſe in the bodies of men by vertue of their ſpirits being inflamed; but then we muſt conſider, that there is but little of that which is called Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or Spirits, in Timber, and ſuch like materials of houſes, as are deſtroyed by Fire; neither is the Fire of any great duration which hath only Spirits for its fuell; as we ſee in the bodies of men, that thoſe Feavers which only fire the Spirits, never laſt above three or four daies, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60264:64"/>many times not above one day; and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called Ephemeral.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore quitted Water, Salt, and Earth, from being the cauſes of Fire; and alſo proved that the Spirits of ſuch kind of bodies which have but little of Spirits in them, cannot contribute much to the maintenance of a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Fire; Sulphur, or the oyly part of each body will appear to be the great Incendiary, and to be more the matter, fuell, and fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fire than any thing elſe. And that it is ſo, doth yet further appear, in that ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all others, are moſt apt to take Fire, and to burn fiercely when they have ſo done, in which there is moſt of a ſulphurious or oily ſubſtance, as Oile it ſelf, Pitch, Tarre, &amp;c. Moreover, we ſee that when any body is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly burnt, the ſulphurious parts are all or moſt of them gone (as if conſcious of what they bad done, they had fled for it) and which is moſt of all demonſtrative, when thoſe parts are once gone, all or moſt of them, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains will burn no longer; as you ſee, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a fire with Aſhes, for that they conſiſt only of Salt and Earth, with little or no commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>Sith then Sulphur or Brimſtone (though in an acceptation ſomewhat different from that which in commonly called by that name) is the great matter of Fire, and the Agitation, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and Flight of it, is the very Form of Fire. I ſhall the leſs wonder hereafter to finde the Scripture ſtill joyning Brimſtone and Fire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 19, 24. <hi>The Lord rained upon Sodom Brimſtone and Fire. Pſal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>On the wicked he ſhalt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60264:65"/>rain Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.33. <hi>The Pile whereof is Fire &amp; much Wood. The breath of the Lord like aſtream of Brimſtone kindleth it, viz. Tophet.</hi> Fire moſt uſually kindleth Fire. A ſtream of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in violent motion is Fire, and here you ſee the <hi>breath of the Lord, is ſaid, like a mighty ſtream of Brimſtone, to kindle Tophet;</hi> which kinde of expreſſion is more genuine and philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal than moſt men know it to be, and may hint unto us, that thorough our ignorance it comes to paſs that many expreſſions in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeem to us no more proper and ſignificant than they do, it faring with us in the reading of holy Writ, as with thoſe that ignorantly walk or ride over precions Mines, little do they think what a world of Treaſure they tread upon; nor if they did, could they be content till they had gotten within the bowels of that ground which now they flightly trample upon. But I have been too long in this Philoſophical contemplation (becauſe it was ſuch) and muſt endeavour to compenſate my prolixity in this with greater Brevity in the reſt, at leaſtwiſe of that ſort, if any ſuch ſhall occur.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>BEing credibly informed that the Element called Sulphur, hath had the greateſt hand under God in the late diſmal Fire (as it hath
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60264:65"/>had in all other, whereby Towns and Cities have been laid waſte) it is but fit we ſhould take him under ſerious examination, and ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what he is, &amp; by what waies and means he brings ſuch great deſolations to paſs. Sulphur, that is, Brimſtone ſo called by Chymiſts, becauſe it hath ſome aſſinity with that which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call Brimſtone, though it be not the very ſame (for our common Brimſtone is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded body, ſo is not that we treat of) is one of thoſe Elements or principles with which all terreſtrial bodies are made up, and whereof they conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>It hath pleaſed the God of nature, who is called <hi>Natura naturans,</hi> that amongſt all things here below, even thoſe which go by the name of Elements, as Air, and Water, and Earth, there ſhould be no one pure and unmixed, and which is more ſtrange, that the principles of which each body is compounded, ſhould be of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and contrary natures, <hi>viz.</hi> hot &amp; cold, moiſt and dry, heavy and light, active and unactive, weak and ſtrong. Yea, that contrariety which is betwixt thoſe Elements of Fire and Water, Earth and Air, which are the Ingredients of each Sublunary, makes for the good of each, and for the benefit of the whole, ſo long as they quietly draw together in that yoak of mixture in which God hath placed them. So that as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. <hi>The eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</hi> Fire cannot ſay to Water, or Water to Fire, or either of them to Earth, I have no need of you. Though ſome of them do curb and limit the Activity
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60264:66"/>of others; yea, the more ignoble put ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon thoſe that are more noble than themſelves; yet in all this they do but what is neceſſary for the well-being, if not alſo for the very being of the <hi>compoſitum. Mercury</hi> and Sulphur would be too volatile and apt to vaniſh, if Earth and water did not hold them in: Water and Earth would be too dull and ſluggiſh, if Sulphur and Mercury did not put life into them. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſaid to abide in mixtion refractly, that is, brokenly, not one of them being able ſo fully to execute its own pleaſure, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it might, if it were all alone; and it is beſt it ſhould be ſo, for if one of them get an abſolute unlimited power, and make vaſſals of all the reſt, preſently all goes to wrack. So in acute Feavers, when either the ſpirits are too high, or the ſulphurious part of the blood; and ſo in chronical Feavers or Agues, when ſalt is become too predominant in the blood, and hath ſowred it (like Ale in Summer) you ſee what work it makes, how it threatens no leſs than death and diſſolution. Yet give me leave to ſay, though no one Element have unlimited power where there is a due mixtion, yet neither is Anarchy or Ataxy to be found in mixt bodies, no not in vegetables, which have the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of life; nor yet in minerals, which have none. For ſome one Element is ſtill predominant over all the reſt hence amongſt men, ſome are connted fanguine, others phlegmatick, &amp;c. there being no where found in bodies that which is called, <hi>I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60264:66"/>ad juſtitiam;</hi> as in a Medicine, in which are ſcruples of gentle purgers, to a few grains of thoſe that are ſtronger, and in each a baſis which is ſupreme over all things in the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; yet not put without its correctives, leſt it ſhould work too violently. You will ſee anon whether all this tends, I ſaid before, that ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is one Element or Ingredient of all terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial bodies, and now I ſhall add, that it is one of the moſt active, noble, and uſeful amongſt them all. If that which is called the Spirit or mercurial part, do excell the ſulphur, as it is ſaid to do, yet doth ſulphur as much excel the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Salt, Water, and Earth; ſo long as it remains in a convenient mixture and dwels peaceably with all the reſt. It were caſie to expatiate in the commendation of Sulphur, ſo placed and qualified as God hath originally placed and qualified it in and with other Elements. Sulphur (ſay Chymiſts, and truly) is as it were the warm boſom in which the ſpirituous parts of all bodies do lodge, the bond of union, or <hi>copula</hi> betwixt ſpirits, and more groſs ſubſtances (as Cartilages or griſtles are betwixt hard bones and more tender parts.) It is that to which moſt bodies do chiefly owe their acceptable colour, taſte, ſent, and amiable tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. From thence moſt vegetables do derive their maturity, ſweetneſs, and moſt other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective qualities. It doth ſuch ſervice in bodies as nothing doth more: namely, it curbs the ſharpneſs of that ſalt which is in them, it blunts the acrimony of the ſpirits, by its ſupple oily quality, it cements and ſodres other elements, which otherwiſe would never hold together;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60264:67"/>being ſomewhat glutinous, it contributes to the conſiſtence of bodies, which would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe over flaid and volutile; in a word, it hath a faculty of reſiſting patrefaction more than any thing elſe, in ſo much that by means thereof Ale may be kept from ſowring in the midſt of Summer, and Juices of Plants from corrupting. All this and much more may be truly affirmed of Sulphur whilſt it keepes its proper place and ſtation.</p>
                     <p>But when this noble and uſeful Element once becomes impatient of the Yoak of mixtion with other Elements, and will no longer indure that water ſhould allay it. Salt ſhould fix it, Earth ſhould clog and retard it, nor yet that the ſpirits though more excellent than its ſelf, ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it, then doth it play the maddeſt pranks imaginable; it breaks away from thoſe other Elements that were joined with it, like an unruly ſervant from his Maſter, that flings open the doors, that who will may come out or go in, leaves all expoſed to rapine and ſpoile, and not content with that, muſters together all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched youth, (ſuch as himſelf) that he can come neer, drawes them away from their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Maſters, and engageth them in the ſame Rebellion with himſelf, and by this meanes it not only ruines all that ſociety, whereof it was before a profitable member, and thoſe which it hath drawn into the ſame conſpiracy, but its ſelf alſo. For it can no more ſubſiſt without thoſe Elements which it hath caſt off, than they can ſubſiſt without it, and ſo it quickly vaniſheth and comes to nothing. I ſay not only the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are left behinde do moulder and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60264:67"/>crumble to duſt and aſhes, but by that meanes its ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> is quickly almoſt annihilated, which is far worſe.</p>
                     <p>Now methinks there ſhould be ſome morality if not Divinity alſo, to be learned from this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſulphur, which if I had deſpaired of, I would never have dived ſo far into it. How naturally then do the following conſiderations offer themſelves from what hath been diſcourſed as touching ſulphur, <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place, how uſeful many men of ſulphurious tempers that is active, ſubtle and vigorous; might be, could they but skill of it to be contented and peaceable? but on the other hand, how dangerous all ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens are, even above others, when once tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with pride or paſſion, affectation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due liberty, or unlimitted dominion?

                     <p>Moreover, how great an embleme is ſulphur of thoſe men and of their miſery, who have not the wiſdome to know when they are well? who want for nothing, and yet cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Such men whilſt they graſp at more, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally loſe what they had, like our firſt parents, who affecting to be as God, knowing good and evil, (when they knew enough already) became like the bruites that periſh, or as Luciſer, (if that be meant of the Devil) who ſaying he would aſcend, and be like the moſt high, <hi>aut Deus aut
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60264:68"/>nullus,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>aut Caeſar aut nullus,</hi> was caſt down to hell.</p>
                     <p>Sulphur is in point of power and dignity the ſecond Element in each body, yet oft times that ſatisfieth it not, but it would have the Throne, which belongeth to the things called ſpirits, and then <hi>Icarus</hi>-like, by ſoaring ſo high, it melts its waxen wings, and falls down into almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>I further obſerve how ſulphur, whilſt it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes other things, deſtroyes its ſelf, ſo many men, whilſt <hi>Sampſon</hi>-like they go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> (as they count them) pluck the houſe (as he did) upon their own heads. Such as are ever biting and devouring others, are like by others to be bitten and devoured. (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15.) The ſad experience we have had in that kind, may ſave me the labour of reflecting yet further, from the nature of Sulphur, upon the danger of an inteſtine War, when one part of the ſame body fights with another, or with all the reſt. Sulphur is a part of thoſe bodies which it preyes upon; and what doth it get by it? it ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines the fabrick it did belong to, and its ſelf to boot, yea ſome parts of the body, after it hath done its worſt, do ſtill remain, when its ſelf is utterly extinct, and no more to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Moreover I obſerve that ſulphur goes about to deſtroy that order, which God hath placed in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> That Elements of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould cohabit and dwell together in peace and concord, (which may be done) for ſo it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in moſt things in the World. Sulphur would make a ſchiſme and a rent, as not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to have its exceſſes corrected, (as it is needful
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60264:68"/>they ſhould be) therefore it fancieth to dwel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; ſues out a divorce, and puts aſunder the things which God had joyned together, and what comes thereof? Doth it not periſh in the doing of it? I am deceived if men of ſo proud a temper, that they can brook no allay of their exceſſes (which are things incident to moſt men, both in opinion and practice) by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of ſuch Elements, as they might ſafely cohabit with, (yea and be happy, though not perfectly humoured in a conjunction with them) do not at length gain as little by it, as enraged Sulphur doth when it flies from the reft of thoſe Elements, to which it was formerly united, and ſoon after dies, like a woman that will needs live from her husband, and ſo ſtarves for want of Alimony. Men of that principle and practice, go about to diſſolve the world, at leaſtwiſe take that courſe that would do it, if followed in all things. For when the great God ſhall aſſign to each Element its proper and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct place, by it ſelf, (in caſe he annihilate them not) which no inſtrument is more fit to effect than Fire,) then will the whole world be at an end.</p>

In a like ſenſe as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>All that is in the world, is the luſt of the fleſh, or the luſt of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60264:69"/>the eye;</hi> meaning as fuel ready for thoſe luſts to kindle upon, and propagate its ſelf by, may it be ſaid that all or moſt things of the World are Fire, as to ſome part of them, that is, as fuell for fire to work upon, and to convert into its own nature.</p>
                     <p>May not this notion of creatures, being conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by their own internal fire, put us in mind how that mans deſtruction alſo is of himſelf, and that our greateſt enemies as Chriſt ſaith, are thoſe of our own houſe. The fire of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from without us could do us no great hurt, were it not for the fire of ſin within us conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſpiring therewith. For every man is then only tempted, that is overcome by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he is inticed and drawn away of his own luſts. It is ſaid of Chriſt that <hi>the Devill came and found nothing in him.</hi> Thereupon it was that the fiery darts which he threw at Chriſt, were preſently quenched and took no effect, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they upon us, if there were nothing in us to comply with them. Woe unto us that we are traytors to our ſelves, and do naturally combine with our greateſt enemies to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh our own ruine.</p>
                     <p>But as thoſe bodies are leaſt incident to fire, in which there is moſt of water, ſalt, or earth, to rebate the petulancy of ſulphur, ſo are thoſe ſoules leſt obnoxious to the injuries of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that have the moſt grace, which in ſcripture is compared ſometimes to water, and other times to ſalt, let your words be ſeaſoned with ſalt, that is, with grace.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then in this life more or leſs of ſin will alwayes cleave to us, as ſo much ſulphur ready
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60264:70"/>to ſet us on fire; labour we to weaken the power of it, by the predominancy of grace, ſo ſhall the remainder of our very ſins in ſome ſenſe, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to our good (as ſulphur to the good of thoſe bodies it is mixed with) as tending to keep us from pride, ſecurity, ſelf-confidence, truſt in our own righteouſneſs, and ſuch like evils, to weaken in us the ſalt ſharp humour of cenſuring others to make our ſpirits more ſerious and conſiſtent by the ſhame and grief which they occaſion in us: ſo ſhall we improve them as vipers in treacle, which ſo mixed, make it the better antidote, and that which was as down-right fire in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it, ſhall become as profitable ſulphur in our reflection upon it, and accommodating of it to the forementioned uſes and purpoſes.</p>

The reaſon is plainly this, things of the ſame kinde do naturally reſort one to another, and conſort each with other, as we ſay proverbially, that <hi>Bards of a feather flock together,</hi> and fire hath a name above all other things for congregating, or calling together things that are homogeneous, or of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as alſo for ſegregating or ſeparating things that are heterogeneous or of a different kinde
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60264:70"/>(in ſo much that that was made the very defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fire by them that knew no better) Now actual Fire, when it bath once ſeparated the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurious particles of other bodies, from thoſe more quiet Elements, which did reſtrain them, whilſt mixed therwith; and when it hath brought thoſe wilde Atomes together, which before were conveniently diſperſed and diſ-joyned each from other, the product is this; that each of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing habitually fire, (as flints are, out of which fire may be ſtruck) what with the irritation they receive from actual fire, and what with that greater ſtrength they have acquired, by being united in ſuch great multitudes, preſently they begin to kindle and ſhow themſelves in actual fire, and as it were, to brandiſh their glittering ſwords, which before they kept as it were in ſcabbards, as by way of triumph, that they had now caſt off the yoak of mixtion, with diſcenting and reſtraining Elements, and poſſeſt themſelves of that liberty which they were alwayes deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of, but could not ſooner attain.</p>
                     <p>Here me thinks, I ſee a lively embleme of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly youth, ſome are actually ſo, others are ſo but habitually, as being under reſtraint from Parents, Maſters, and other Governors, who do all that in them lies to keep thoſe fiery mettal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome youths from conſorting each with other, leſt by that meanes they ſhould inflame each other: (as beames of the Sun concentered in a burning glaſs, are able to kindle fire, which ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and diſperſed they could never do.) Now when ſome or more of theſe young men or maides, actually wicked and debaucht, as having already caſt off the yoak of all government,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60264:71"/>and run away from thoſe that did and ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them; either openly or ſecretly, lights into the company of thoſe that are habitually ſuch as themſelves, and have great propenſions to the ſame things: firſt he tempts and inticeth them away from under the juriſdiction and ſociety of thoſe that have hitherto reſtrained them (as to their luſts,) then he joynes them to as great a number as he can, of ſuch young ranters as themſelves, who mutually encourage one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an evil way, and ſtrengthen the hand each of other, to do that in heards and troops, which they would dread to do ſingly, and one by one, and when it is come to that, then doth the wickedneſs which heretofore they ſmothered, flame out; they are preſently all on a light fire, and ſo continue (if God extinguiſh it not) till having utterly conſumed themſelves by ſin, they come to juſt nothing, or what is worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; as that which we call <hi>Fire,</hi> domineers a while, and carries all before it, but by and by it vaniſheth, and we know no more of it (ſave that it oft-times leaves an ugly ſtink behind it.) To give this fair warning to young men and women, ready to be debauched by the next ill company, is all the uſe I ſhall make of that moſt known way of kindling fire, which is by fire its ſelf, where the allegory you ſee holds in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and improves a truth to our hands, which might ſeem not worth our taking notice of, becauſe every foole knowes it.

                     </head>
                     <p>THey ſay that fire is ſometimes kindled by means of Putrefaction, &amp; it ſeems evident from experiments, both without and within our ſelves, that ſo it is. What are Feavers, but as it were ſo many fires kindled in the bodies of men? Elſe how do they make the blood to boile in our veines, and ſo exceedingly rariſie, it that the veſels are painfully diſtended by it, and are ſcarce able to contain it? or how come they to make ſuch a heap of aſhes in the body, as appeareth to be made by that deep ſediment that is in the urine when the diſeaſe begins to decline, or (as it is vulgarly called) to break a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Theſe hints may ſufficiently prove that Feavers are Internal fires; and whence are moſt of thoſe ſires (at leaſtwiſe that are of any long continuance) but from Putrefaction, and thence called Putrid Feavers? Now as for Corruption or Putrefaction, it is thus defined, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is the ſeparation of thoſe parts and principles which were before mutually combined (the band of their union being diſſolved) or that it is the diſſolution of, or reſolution of a compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded body, into all or moſt of thoſe principles or elements of which it was compounded, ſome taking their flight one way, and ſome another. Now this ſeparation or divorce of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of bodies one from another, contributeth to the inkindling fire by this means, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the ſulphurous particles get looſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60264:72"/>from the reſt, then do they combine together, and break away with great heat and violence from thoſe leſs active Elements, to which they were joyned before, and thence comes Fire. Thus in putrid Feavers, the due mixture and compoſition of the blood is very much deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the thicker and thinner parts affecting as it were to be each by themſelves (like the whey and curds in milk, that is ſowred or turned) which were before perfectly united. Then the ſulphurious or oily part of the blood, thus ſet at liberty, flies thorough the body with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſets all into a combuſtion. And this is the great inſtance, as from within our ſelves, of Fire ariſing from Putrefaction. As for an experiment from without, one may ſuffice, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Dung, which lying together in heaps, and ſo putrifying more and more, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wax ſo hot, that it ſets fire on the ſtraw that is mingled with it: which is long of its ſulphurious parts by putrefaction, ſet at liberty, and flying away in great troops, and with much violence.</p>
                     <p>And is there nothing to be made of all this beſides matter of Speculation? You know what corruption and putrefaction doth ſignifie in a moral ſenſe; and ſure I am that kind of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is the cauſe of all the miſchievous fires that are in the world. Did God drown the old world, becauſe all fleſh had corrupted its ſelf? and did he not burn <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> for the ſame cauſe? So likewiſe <hi>Jeruſalem, Jer.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 13. The Scripture calls ſinful communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60264:72"/>corrupt or putrifie good manners. Many fires are kindled by ſuch communication, <hi>viz.</hi> fires of luſt, and fires of anger, and of revenge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe fires of judgment and vengeance which God ſends upon the world for the ſame. <hi>James</hi> 3.6. <hi>The tongue is a fire, a world of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and is ſet on fire of Hell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, if we take the word putrefaction ſtrictly for a ſeceſſion or ſeparation of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or elements formerly united, in that accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is capable of a good moral, and may ſerve to teach us how great the danger of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſeparation and diſunion is, even amongſt thoſe whoſe principles do ſo far forth diſagree that they cannot be together, but refractly, as fire and water in mixtion: Yet theſe in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bodies, as contrary as they ſeem, do much better in a convenient mixture and compoſition, than they ever can ſingly and apart: yea when they fall in pieces, though one bear a greater ſway for the preſent than before, and that the worthieſt of all the reſt (as it might be the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in Ephemeral Feavers) yet as well that part which rules more abſolutely than ever for the time being, as thoſe parts which are more than ever ſubjected to it, is quickly deſtroyed and brought to nothing.</p>
                     <p>Natural bodies cannot be miſtaken about their own party (which are really ſuch) but by a kinde of infallible inſtinct, do draw thoſe parts out of other bodies, which are for kinde the ſame with themſelves, as the kindled ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur that is in one body, kindles and drawes forth that ſulphur which is in another, and yet it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60264:73"/>proves unhappy and fatal to thoſe bodies (as to ſulphur in particular) that they divide from all others, and will unite only amongſt themſelves, though they are all perfectly of the ſame ſpecies, and no more than juſt numerically differenced. How it ſhould be more ſafe for men to do the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> to abſtract and divorce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all, but thoſe that are of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, whilſt mean time divers may be ſuch, only in pretence, and for their own ends for ought they know, and others whom they reject may heartily ſymbolize with them in more things; I ſay, how that can be prudent or ſafe, I am yet to learn.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that affect that ſimplicity which is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to God, and his alone prerogative, let them conceive a diſpleaſure againſt the compoſition of their own bodies, and try concluſions to make them conſiſt but of one Element, and that the nobleſt of all. Let them quarrel four of thoſe five principles which are the ingredients of our bodies, and reſolve to turn ſulphur, ſalt, Earth and Water out of doors, and that they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of meer ſpirits, and to that end let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt thoſe ſpirituous liquors that are in them, to the greateſt height that may be, that ſo they may be able to turn thoſe four inferiour principles out of poſſeſſion, and live alone in and throughout the whole body, all the veines and arteries being henceforth filled with ſpirits only in ſtead of blood: Try how this experiment will ſucceed. If it do well, attempt the like thing upon the Church and State, bring them to the ſame paſs. But if you finde this likely to ſet on fire the whole courſe of nature, to ſet you in a violent
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60264:73"/>feaver that will ſoon burn you to death, be ſo juſt as not to wiſh that ſhould be done to others that you would by no meanes have done to your ſelves; and ſuſpect that may be bad for publick bodies, which would be ſo deſtructive to your own private. Let one principle bear rule over all the reſt, (as in good Wines the ſpirituous parts are predominant) and let the nobleſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſway the Scepter, elſe things will degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: (as Wines do into Vinegar, when the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are kept under, and the ſaline or ſaltiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles exalted:) but let the leſs noble Elements not be excluded, but fairly comprehended in a due mixtion and ſubordination, otherwiſe if it fare with men (as it doth with fire) that which aſpires to be all in all, will ſoon vaniſh, and be as it were annihilated.</p>

                     <p>AS obvious almoſt as any of the former, is the way of kindling fire by the colliſion or ſmiting together of two hard bodies, as when ſlint &amp; ſteel are ſtruck one againſt the other: the reaſon why fire iſſues from thence, is, becauſe by the blow given, the ſulphurious particles of the ſteel and flint are put in motion. Now inward they cannot move, becauſe theſe bodies being hard and of cloſe parts, do ſuffer nothing to get within them, for as much as there can be no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating of dimenſions. Therefore our they muſt come, and if they could come out leiſurely
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60264:74"/>and by degrees, they would produce no fire, or ſcarce ſo much as heat, but ſallying forth in great haſte, and all at once, as if they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the blow they had received, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their number, union, and violent motion, they ingender ſparks, &amp; produce that fire which we diſcern to come from them.</p>
                     <p>Juſt thus it is betwixt perſons of ſtout and ſturdy ſpirits, when they happen to claſh one againſt another, retreat and retire into themſelves they cannot, to deliberate, and conſider what they had beſt to do; ſo full are they of themſelves, that is, of their pride and paſſion, but out they come, being once put into a commotion, and with all the ſpirits they can make &amp; muſter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aſſaile each other, and with their drawn glittering ſwords, do as it were fire at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with greateſt eagerneſs purſue a bloody duell.</p>
                     <p>Now oh the folly of men, Do they not know that the conteſts and incounters of two great ſpirits, is as like to produce ſuch a bloody iſſue as the ſmiting of ſlint and ſteel together, is to bring out Fire, and yet they will give way to it upon every ſlight occaſion, as if they had leſs conſideration than the devil himſelf, who ſaid, skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life: but they will give or throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their lives upon every trifling provocation, as if they were nothing worth. I wonder who it is that doth ſo highly honour the memory of men dying upon thoſe termes, that perſons of quality ſhould be ambitious of it?</p>
                     <p>I wender in whoſe Kallender it is, that ſuch kinde of perſons are put down for Martyrs, Saints
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60264:74"/>and Worthy-men! I wonder what heathen God it is, whom men think to pleaſe with ſuch kinde of ſacrifices (for the true God doth moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly abhor them) I wonder that men who ſtand ſo much upon the nobleneſs of their blood (as if each drop of theirs were more worth than all that runs in the veins of ordinary men) ſhould trivially pour it out, or hazard it to be poured out, like water upon the ground, and at the ſame time everlaſtingly tain it, by ſheding the blood of others, either actually or intentionally. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Lamech,</hi> and theſe men deſerve to be canonized all in one day, at leaſtwiſe it is very ſit that all their names ſhould be written in red cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that is, in letters of blood.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhall we ſay to thoſe perſons, who make it their buſineſs to knock thoſe ſlints and ſteels againſt each other, and then to finde tinder to receive the ſparks, and matches to procure the flame, (that tinder of its ſelf could not) that is, to ſet perſons of great and ſturdy ſpirits together by the eares to foment their differences, and to make them thirſty after one anothers blood. If that rule in Law be true, <hi>Plus peccat Author quam Actor.</hi> If any ſuch two ſhall happen to kill one another in a duel, or ſo, they will be murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but you will be greater murtherers than they.</p>
                     <p>I can ſcarcely think of two hard bodies by their mutual attrition fetching fire out of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not meditate that thus it is when two Nations fall at oddes, they are alwayes firing one at another, and the reaſon is, becauſe they are hard bodies, and neither can yield, (one cannot yield in point of right, nor the other in point of honour) and ſo thoſe ſparkes are continually
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60264:75"/>ſtruck from each, which fomented by that tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ill-willers to both do cheriſh it with, and propagated by dangerous matches, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies, breaks out into that flame which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may never come to be extinguiſhed. Oh how do I long for the accompliſhment of that promiſe! <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6. <hi>The Wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lie down with the kid, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.2.

Thus it is, when perſons of rough and rugged tempers are marcht and mated with thoſe that are of a quite contrary diſpoſition (<hi>viz.</hi> full of the Ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit) though that which is hard may daſh againſt that which is ſoft, yet no fire of contention is thereby inkindled, becauſe that which is ſoft ſoon yields, and ſo prevents the quarrel.

May I never be one of thoſe hard things which help to kindle fire, either national, domeſtical, or otherwiſe, but always poſſeſt of that chriſtian ſoftneſs, that may prevent the kindling of thoſe things, which upon a little undue colliſion would be all in ſparks, if not in flames.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THere is one way more whereby Fires are ſometimes kindled, the conſideration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is capable enough of a practical improvement, and therefore I ſhall not paſs it by, and that is, by denying convenient vent to bodies, that are full of ſulphur. Thence it is, that Hay that is laid up too wet, and lies too cloſe together, is frequently ſet on fire, becauſe by that meanes thoſe ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious particles, which would otherwiſe have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled by degrees, are pent in, and being ſo, do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate one with another, provoke and excite each other, and when they have gotten a ſufficient number of them together, with united force do as it were break Priſon (for want of leave to go out quietly, now and then ſome of them, or ſome by ſome) and fly away like lightning. And thence is that fire which ſometimes is kindled in Hay, and other times in dung, upon the ſame account. Thoſe active particles which affected more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than they could ſingly obtain, and ſuch as might have been given them without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (for dry hay the ſulphurious particles wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do exhale freely by ſome and ſome, doth not kindle of its ſelf) combine together to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free, as if they were of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s minde, who ſaid, <hi>Omnia dat, qui juſta negat,</hi> when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied ſome priviledge, which he might juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. But thoſe are not words fit to be taken into a ſubjects mouth.</p>
                     <p>Yet as unlawful as it is for thoſe that are under authority to act or ſpeak at any ſuch rate, as that of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> I cannot but think withall, that it is no point of prudence in Parents, Maſters. and other Governors, to deny to thoſe that are under them that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60264:76"/>deſirable liberty which they may ſafety give, any more than to give them that liberty which a due care of ſafety bids them to deny. That profound Philoſopher and Stateſman the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> in his Eſſayes, <hi>pag.</hi> 86. ſpeaks thus. To give mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate liberty for griefes and diſcontentments to evaporate, (ſo it be without too great inſolency or bravery) is a ſafe way. For he that turns the humours back, and makes the wound bleed inwards, indangereth maligne Ulcers and pernicious impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humations.</p>

                     <head>CONTEMPLATION VIII. <hi>Of Fire kindled by pouring on Water, as in Lime.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT is famouſly known that Fire is ſometimes kindled, otherwhiles encreaſed, even by the pouring on of water. By that means Lime is made to burn; which though it flame not our, yet both by its hiſſing, and ſmoaking, as alſo by its ability to burn other things, doth appear it ſelf to be ſet on fire. And we may daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Smiths do ſprinkle water upon their forges, thereby cauſing the Fire therein to burn ſo much the more eagerly. The reaſon of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> of Lime its burning when it meets with Water, ſeems to be this: Some particles of Fire do remain in Lime, after it hath been burnt in the Furnace (though cooled again) but cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united with certain particles of Salt, and by them moderated and kept quiet. But when water is poured upon it, then is the aſſociation that was betwixt the particles of Fire, and of Salt diſſolved, and the earthy parts ſeparated, which before lay betwixt the fiery particles, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from joyning each with other, which being done, they all flock together and rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz by themſelves, and ſo violently ſally out together, and forcibly take their flight in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable body or party, and thence comes that Fire which is kindled in Lime, which is true Fire, though it flame not by reaſon of thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery parts which are commixed therewith, which cauſe ſmoak inſtead of flame.</p>
                     <p>Now when I think of Fire kindled by water, (its known oppoſite) in Lime as aforeſaid, me thinks the corrupt nature of man is juſt like
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60264:77"/>Lime; for when it meets with the holy Law of God, which is as contrary to it as water to Fire, (I mean, to the luſts and corruptions that are in it) how is it inkindled and enflamed thereby? Hence that complaint of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Sin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion by the commandement wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence. For without the Law ſin was dead,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>But ſin, that it might appear ſin, working death in me by that which was good, that ſin by the Commandement might become exceeding ſinful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, whereas thoſe particles of Fire which are in Lime, are as it were, ſo many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners, or forraign gueſts that get into it, when the Lime-ſtones were burning within the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace (for in Lime it ſelf there is little Sulphur, as appeareth by the difficulty of burning all or moſt of it away) and theſe forraign particles are they that do expoſe it unto being ſet onfire whenwater is put to it, I cannot but thence think of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Kingdoms and Countries which are over-ſtocked with forraigners (eſpecially if of a forraign Religion as well as Nation) eſpecially if men of fiery principles and ſpirits: for though ſuch perſons may lie ſtill and make no noiſe for a time, ſo long as there are other parties to ballance and tie their hands (as the particles of Salt doth that of Fire) and whilſt they are not ſuffered to imbody and flock together; yet let an enemy come (like water upon lime) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they hiſs, and ſmoak, and reak, and heard together, and are ready to burn up all that comes neer them. May the Popiſh party never verifie what I have now hinted from the nature of Lime.</p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:60264:77"/>
                     <p>Neither is it unapt to be ſignificantly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Smiths do intend the heat of their fires by ever and anon ſprinkling on them ſmall quantities of water. Did they throw on much water it would extinguiſh it, but that little they uſe now and then, makes it to burn more fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. What better reſemblance can there be of the over-mild rebukes of parents towards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and diſſolute children. As good or better not chide, or not correct them at all, as do it over-gently, and <hi>Eli</hi> like, who only ſaid, <hi>It is not a good report I heare of you my ſons, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.24. Were ſuch deeds as theirs to be corrected only with words; eſpecially with ſuch ſoft words as thoſe, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Why do you ſuch things? Nay my ſons, for it is no good report that I hear.</hi> Did they <hi>lie with the women that aſſembled at the door of the Tabernacle,</hi> and is this all he hath to ſay to them? He had even as good have held his peace. This was but water ſprinkled upon the forge; this was but like an over-gentle purge, that ſtirs and troubles humors; but brings them not away. Thus to whip as it were with a fan of Feathers, is but to make an offenders remedy (which is correction) contemptible, and himſelf thereby more incorrigible. When the water of rebuke or correction muſt be uſed, take enough to quench the Fire, though not to drown or ſink the offender.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Lime that kindles at the approach of water (which one would think ſhould rather quench it if kindled before) is methinks a good embleme of Chriſtian zeale, and a good pattern for us in that behalf. Should not our zeal be heightned by oppoſition, like flouds that ſwell
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60264:78"/>when they come at banks that hinder them. So did the zeal of <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Michal</hi> derided him for dancing before the Ark. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.22. <hi>I will yet be more vile</hi> than thus (ſaid he) <hi>viz. if that were to be vile,</hi> to rejoyce before the Ark of God. So <hi>Paul,</hi> when ſome perſwaded him not to goe to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for fear of being bound there, made this anſwer, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. <hi>I am ready not to be bound only, but to die at Jeruſalem for the name of Chriſt.</hi> Thus were their diſſwaſions like water thrown upon Lime, which did meerly kindle it. Thus you ſee the way of kindling Lime ſhews us both what our Corruptions are, and what our Graces ſhould be, and woe unto us that our Corruptions have that vigour which our Graces want.</p>
                     <p>Henceforth then, by the help of God, I will endeavour that my luſts may be like green wood, which though it lie upon the fire, will hardlie burn, as being choked with its own moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and that the Graces of Gods Spirit may be in me as ſo much Lime, the fiery particles whereof meeting with their old enemy water, preſently break off their aſſociation with other Elements, firmly unite among themſelves, and of potential fire become actual, and ſend up thoſe watery particles in ſmoak, which went about to extinguiſh them. If I cannot flame (as Lime cannot) yet I will endeavour to be as ſmoaking Lime or Flax, which Chriſt will not quench; and when I can do no more at preſent againſt thoſe luſts which fight againſt my ſoul: I will as it were hiſs at them, as lime doth at the approach of water, that is, teſtify my diſpleaſure and indignation againſt them.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60264:82"/>or could be. I think it is ſo far from being a ſin to put the judgements of God, as it were, into a ſcale, that we may learn how heavy they are (ſo far as we can attain) that I queſtion not but it is a duety, and am ſure it was the practice of that ſenſible Prophet holy <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Lam. 4.6. <hi>The puniſhment of the Iniquity of the Daughter of my People, is greater than the puniſhment of the ſin of</hi> Sodome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There we ſee he layes the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Sodome</hi> in one ſcale, and that of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in another, and weighing them againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, concludes the latter to have been the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the two: Yea, indeed the whole Book of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations</hi> is, as it were, a pair of Ballances hung up, into which the Prophet is caſting in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall miſeries of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> parcell by parcell (as he could take them up) till he had thrown in all; that he and others might underſtand to what weight the whole ſum did amount. Though there are ſome that are ready to faint under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements of the Lord, yet more are apt to deſpiſe them, eſpecially after ſome time, and when the ſurprize is over, and in caſe they themſelves are not ſo immediately, or ſo deeply concerned in them as others are. Then are they ready to ſay to others in reference to their loſſes, as the chief Prieſts and Elders did to <hi>Iudas,</hi> in reference to the trouble of his mind, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.4. <hi>What is that to us? look thou to that:</hi> Or to ſhew themſelves <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> like of whom we read, that when the Greeks took <hi>Softhenes</hi> the chief Ruler of the Synagogue and beat him before the Judgement-ſeat, <hi>Gallio</hi> cared for none of thoſe things. Though he ſaw a Perſon of Quality and of Integrity unjuſtly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a publike way, he regarded it not. Let the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60264:82"/>
                        <hi>Gallio's</hi> of this Age read what I am now to write us touching the miſeries of poor <hi>London,</hi> and be perfectly unconcerned if they can, or exempt themſelves, if it be poſſible, from having any ſhare in that Calamity which they ſeem to ſlight, as if it were nothing to them, or as if the late fire had not ſo much as ſinged one hair of their heads, neither would, at the long run. I dare warrant them, that gray hairs of miſery are upon them alſo (and upon that account,) though they know it not.</p>
                     <p>When I enter upon the Meditation of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> deſtruction, I had need to fortifie my ſelf with thoſe words of <hi>Solomon, viz.</hi> that <hi>It is better to go to the Houſe of mourning, than to the Houſe of feaſting,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.2. For ſuch a diſcourſe can be no other, than as it were a Houſe of mourning, yea, <hi>As the mourning of</hi> Hadadrimmon <hi>in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of</hi> Megiddon, Zach. 12.11. And now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Book of <hi>Ieremy</hi> called <hi>Lamentations</hi> doth ſo wonderfully ſuit the preſent caſe of <hi>London,</hi> as if it had been calculated for the Meridian of that City, rather than of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or as if God had ſtretched out upon <hi>London</hi> the ſame line of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he did upon <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or as if thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine thunder bolts, which were ſhot againſt both thoſe famous Cities, had been made in one and the ſame mold, or as God ſpeaks, Amos 4.11. <hi>I have overthrown ſome of you, as God overthrew</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah. So, as God overthrew <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> in like manner, and with many the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances hath he deſtroyed <hi>London.</hi> Our ſins were much what the ſame with theirs (as I have ſhewed, when I ennumerated the procuring cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of fire) and it is but juſt, that our plagues and puniſhments ſhould be the ſame likewiſe.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60264:83"/>Now where ſhall I begin my diſcourſe of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> calamity? Or how can I do it without premiſing thoſe words of the Prophet, Jerem. 9.11. <hi>Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears,</hi> &amp;c. If my eyes be not a fountain my heart muſt needs be a Rock, and Lord ſmite thou that Rock, that waters may guſh out, whil'ſt I mention thoſe things that ſhould be bewailed, even with tears of blood.</p>
                     <p>That which firſt preſents its ſelf is the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what <hi>London</hi> was, nor can it be better expreſſed than in thoſe words, Lam. 1.1 <hi>The City that was Great amongſt the Nations, and Princeſſe amongſt the Provinces.</hi> Sure I am <hi>London</hi> was the glory of <hi>England,</hi> yea the glory of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> yea the glory of theſe three Nations, if not in ſome ſenſe the glory of the whole World. But as the Prophet ſpeaks of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>She came down wonderfully,</hi> the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>London.</hi> But alas! What is <hi>London</hi> now, but another <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> lying in aſhes? What is it but a heap of duſt and rubbiſh? The greateſt part of it ſeems to be convered into ſo many Church-yards, as conſiſting of nothing, but the Reliques of Churches, with waſte ground round about them, full of open Vaults or Cellers, like ſo many uncovered Graves, and fragments of houſes like ſo many dead mens bones ſcattered on every ſide of them: I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt called it another <hi>Smithfield</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>May we not go on with thoſe words of <hi>Ieremy</hi> Lam. 1.1. <hi>How doth the City ſit ſolitary, that was full of people?

To ſee a populous City ſo wofully depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated in a few dayes time, and the late Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants driven away as ſtubble before the wind; Whoſe heart would it not cauſe to bleed? How oft have I heard men ſay ſince the Fire we have occaſion to uſe ſuch and ſuch tradeſmen, that uſe to work to us but know not were to find them, we ſhould ſpeak with ſuch and ſuch Friends, but know not what is become of them, or whether they are gone. How many thouſand houſes (that were lately ſuch) do not now contain one Inhabitant, nor are ſit to do it. This alſo ſhould be for a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. Did the Egyptians mourn, when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60264:84"/>but one was miſſing in every houſe, and ſhall not we when multitudes of whole houſholds and houſes are ſwept away all at once?</p>
                     <p>Why ſhould I doubt to ſay, that a great part of the ſtrength and defence of all <hi>England,</hi> yea, of all the three Kingdomes, is loſt and taken away, in and by the deſtruction of <hi>London?</hi> Was not that great City able to have raiſed a mighty force in a ſhort time, wherewith to have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed an invading Forreigner? Was it not a Mine of Treaſure, able to ſupply vaſt ſummes of monie for the uſe of King and Kingdome, at a ſhort warning: and found as willing as able to do it? If a vaſt and ſtately Ship, as moſt that ſwim in the Ocean had been loſt, how ſoon could, and did that famous City build ſuch another? Surely, <hi>London</hi> was the ſinews and the very right hand of all great and publick undertakings; and that they knew full well, that ſaid in their hearts, Raſe it, Raſe it to the very ground. Are we not now like <hi>Sampſon</hi> when his hair was cut, and ſhould we go out to ſhake our ſelves as he did, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.20. ſhould we not preſently find it?

                     <p>Is it not worth taking notice of, that the beauty and ſplendor of <hi>England</hi> is defaced and loſt by the deſtruction of <hi>London?</hi> How deformed is a body without a head? and was not <hi>London</hi> the head of <hi>England,</hi> in that ſence that <hi>Damaſcus</hi> is ſaid to have been the head of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the head of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> to have been <hi>Samaria, Iſa.</hi> 7.8. That is the head City, for we acknowledge a head Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to that, yea, Supreme under God, <hi>viz.</hi> our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, as it is, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. the head of <hi>Ephraim</hi> is <hi>Remaliahs</hi> Son. As the face is to the body, ſo was <hi>London</hi> to <hi>England, viz.</hi> the beautifulleſt part of it, and look how men reckon it a great prejudice to their bodies when their faces are marred by any great deformity, ſo is it to the whole Land (which is to be conſidered as one body, and all the parts of it as members of each other) when ſcarce any thing of that is left which was the very face of it. They that ſaw only the other parts of <hi>England</hi> ſaw (as I may allude with reverence) but it's back parts. Was not <hi>London</hi> as it were the Throne of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſucceſſively, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in compariſon of it, but as it were their Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool?

Now who can be a true Engliſhman and unconcerned for the honour of his Nation, and not troubled to ſee it lie in the duſt? How is the honour of a Nation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on? How many wars are commenced and continued in the world to vindicate the honour of particular Nations? How hard is it for Nations to recede from the very punctillio's of their honour? Now if God hath diſgraced us and weakned our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60264:85"/>reputation (as certainly he hath done) by taking away the great City, ſurely it ſhould be for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation? If our Father hath ſpit in our face, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Mariam, ought we not to be aſhamed ſeven dayes,</hi> yea, ſeven years we had need for ſuch a ſpitting of fire in our face, as hath befallen us? <hi>Jeremy</hi> puts it amongſt his Lamentations, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.6. <hi>From the Daughter of</hi> Zion <hi>all her beauty is departed.</hi> We proceed.</p>
                     <p>Whoſe heart would it not grieve, to think what precious fuel went to feed that pernicious fire? Goodly Houſes, noble Halls, belonging to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Companies, ancient and worthy Hoſpitals, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording relief to multitudes of poor and diſtreſſed people, magnificent Churches built (and ſome of them but lately repaired) at a very great charge, places of Judicature, and for the honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Magiſtrates, as <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and others, Common places (as I may call them) of Trade and Tradeſmen, ſuch as <hi>Blackwell-hall,</hi> and the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> (the onely ſanctuary that I hear of, to it's own Founder,) uſeful and eminent Schools, as <hi>Pauls,</hi> and others, one famous rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacle of Divines, by the name of <hi>Zion</hi> Colledge, another for Civilians, one Cathedral, for large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtatelineſs of building, exceeding all that I have before mentioned. All theſe are well known to have been fuel to that fire; yea, all theſe were but a part of it's fuel. There were other things, which though they did not as to bulk e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize thoſe I have mentioned, yet in worth and value did far exceed them. In ſome places you might have ſeen rich wines, it may be Sack and Hippocras, burning for no bodies uſe, elſwhere coſtly Oils ſwimming about the ſtreets, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60264:85"/>converted into flames. Was not the fire fed in ſome places with rich houſholdſtuffe, and dear furniture, in others with ſhop-goods and wares of great value, as fine clothes, and ſuch like, which their owners wanted opportunity to ſend away? How many precious druggs, and odoriferous ſpices went up in thoſe flames, as ſo much incenſe? How many wholſome Medicines, and powerfull Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, and great Cordials, ſuch as Mithridate, Treacle, Spirituous Liquors, Bezoardick Powders, Confection of Alchermies, Chymical Oils, and Spirits, were in great quantities conſumed by that fire, as if they had been good for nothing, or as if nothing had been too good for it. And above all other loſſes, What Scholler, (that is ſo indeed,) can with drie eyes mention the ineſtimable loſſe of books that was ſuſtained by that mercileſſe fire, to the undoing of many Bookſellers, in one ſence, and of many more Schollers in another.

                        </gap>s the word of God, the Bible it's ſelf, as to many hundred Copies of it, was then taken from us and burnt (as if it had been a piece of hereſie, or had fallen into Popiſh hands, who brook it not in our genuine tranſlations.) And this were more to be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60264:86"/>lamented than all the reſt, if that ſacred book, that book of books, might not more eaſily be reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than many others that are of greater volume, and of which there are but few Copies extant. But as for our <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> midwived into the world at a vaſt charge, and by the unſpeakable induſtry of many learned and famous men, to the great renown of themſelves and of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how many of them were conſumed, as if they had been ſo much waſte paper, and who is able to repair the loſſe? Theſe things, as I ſaid before, were the fuel that fed the flames of <hi>London, Quis talia fando Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret a lachrymis?</hi> Who can think of ſuch things as theſe, and not draw waters and poure out before the Lord, as the Iſraelites did at <hi>Mizpah?</hi> To have made, or fed as many bonefires, as are uſuall upon great ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with meer Musk and Ambergreaſe, (if ſo much could have been had) had not been ſo great a charge and loſſe, as were all thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials which went to foment the diſmall fire of <hi>London.</hi> Thoſe flames were higher fed (all things conſidered) than <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was, when, as it is ſtoried of her, ſhe drank diſſolved Pearls. How angry was the Almighty with us, when he would rather fling all this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into the fire than ſuffer us to enjoy it? How unworthy did he proclaim us, when, in fact, he ſaid, better the fire ſhould have it than we?</p>
                     <p>But where did all this loſſe light? Was it upon <hi>LONDON</hi> only? Were few or none ſufferers but the Inhabitants of that City? Yea, doubtleſs, it was a terrible blow to the whole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60264:86"/>Nation or to the greateſt part of it. Who had any conſiderable intereſt in <hi>England,</hi> and none in <hi>London</hi> more or leſſe? As all Rivers run into the Sea, and all the lines of a Circumference meet in one Center, ſo did the intereſt of moſt conſiderable Engliſhmen, in <hi>London.</hi> Who had not ſome ſhare in that great ſhip, as I may call it, which is now blown up? They that had no immediate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall intereſt in <hi>London,</hi> Had they not Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Brothers or Siſters, yea it may be Sons or Daughters, or if not ſo, Kindred more remote, that were great ſufferers by this fire, and whoſe loſſes they ſhould lay to heart. <hi>Nero</hi> is ſaid to have wiſhed that <hi>Rome</hi> had had but one Neck, that he might cut it off at a blow. In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>England, London</hi> was next to that one Neck, and hath not this fire cut it off at one blow? His Majeſty hath told us that his loſſe in the City was greater than any other mans, and what good Subject would not bewail that? But ſurely Reader it is thy loſſe, if thou art an Engliſh Proteſtant, as truely, though not as much as his. The loſſe was Catholick (that is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall) in the conſequences, as well as Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick in the Cauſes of it. But is this all that can be ſaid of the loſſe of <hi>London?</hi> Surely no, Read but the Book of <hi>Lamentations</hi> and you will find many more expreſſions applicable to the Caſe of <hi>London,</hi> beſides thoſe which I have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of already, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.4. There ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>The wayes of Sion mourn, becauſe none come to the Solemn feaſts, her gates are deſolate.</hi> All theſe their calamities are come upon us at once. Our Gates are laid waſte, our ſelemn Aſſemblies both Religious and Civil in moſt places of that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60264:87"/>which was called <hi>London,</hi> are unavoidably at an end, and if our wayes do not mourn, that is, if they have not a ſad and a ghaſtly appearance let all that paſſe by them Judge. Surely <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is now the ſaddeſt ſpectacle that is this day in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doth the circumſtance of time in which this fire befel us, add nothing to our affliction? Had we at the ſame time had many friends, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies but few or none, our miſery had been leſs: For then ſhould we have been much pitied, which had been ſome mitigation of our loſs: but did it not befal us at a time when we had few friends, but many forreign enemies round about us. This <hi>Jeremy</hi> lamented in reference to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Lam. 1.2. <hi>Amongſt all her lovers ſhe hath none to comfort her, all her friends have dealt treacherouſly with her, they are become her enemies.</hi> Is it no aggravation of our miſery (ſurely it cannot be otherwiſe) to think how wretchedly our many enemies will triumph and inſult, becauſe of it, and cry, Ah, ah, ſo would they have it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>All mine enemies have heard of my trouble, they are glad that thou haſt done it.</hi> And <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>All that paſs by clap their hands, they hiſs, and wag their head, for the daughter of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, ſaying, Is this the City that men call the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>All thine enemies ſay, This is the day that we looked for, we have found, we have ſeen it,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>The Lord hath cauſed thine enemies to rejoyce over thee, he hath ſet up the horn of thine adverſaries.</hi> Alſo in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.14, 45. You may ſee how much ſtreſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremy</hi> did lay upon the inſultings of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and how humbling a conſideration he took it for. When enemies congratulate our miſeries in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60264:87"/>ſtead of condoling them, it adds much. Surely <hi>France,</hi> but for ſhame, had rung bells, and made bonfires when the tidings of our fire did arrive there. God would that a people ſhould lay it to heart, when he expoſeth them to contempt. <hi>Jeruſalem hath grievouſly ſinned, therefore ſhe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved</hi> (ſo is <hi>London</hi>) <hi>all that honoured her, deſpiſe her, becauſe they have ſeen her nakedneſs.</hi> He loves not his countrey that cares not how it is ſlighted, or who inſults over it.</p>
                     <p>What if it can be made out that there is no paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel at this day for <hi>London</hi>'s calamity, ſhould not that be for a lamentation, that God ſhould ſo puniſh us, as if he would make us an example to all the world, or as if we had been the worſt people in the world? <hi>Ieremy</hi> took that circumſtance to heart in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s caſe, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.13. <hi>What thing ſhall I liken to thee Oh daughter of Ieruſalem? What ſhall I equal to thee that thou maiſt be comforted?</hi> So <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.12. <hi>For under the whole heaven hath not been done ſo great evil, as hath been done upon Ieruſalem.</hi> If the like may be ſaid of <hi>London,</hi> (and indeed I have heard no man pretend the contrary at this day) its miſery muſt needs be great. If it be an unparallel'd ſtroke it muſt needs carry a great face of Divine wrath and diſpleaſure with it, and that doth add much, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.1. <hi>How hath the Lord covered the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion with a cloud in his Anger? and remembred not his footſtool in the day of his Anger.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>He hath cut off in his fierce Anger all the horns of Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many things in this judgement ſeemed to carry with them a great face of Divine Anger, as namely, for that the Lord ſeemed to deſtroy <hi>London,</hi> ſo far as he went without any pity. Such a thing as this is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60264:88"/>bewailed, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The Lord hath ſwallowed up all the habitations of Iacob and hath not pitied,</hi> And verſe 17. <hi>The Lord hath thrown down and hath not pitied.</hi> If God had taken away the houſes of rich men that could have born their loſs, and mean time ſpared the houſes of ſuch as were poor, there had been pity in that, but he was pleaſed to take all before him, and with the ſame beſome of deſtruction to ſweep away the habitious of the pooreſt, as well as of the moſt rich. And did not God's turning a deaf ear to all the prayers and interceſsions that were made, as for the greateſt part of <hi>London</hi> whilſt the fire was, and going on to deſtroy not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding though they cried unto him day and night that he would ſtay his hand and ſpare the remainder, I ſay did not that ſpeak God exceeding angry. This was one of <hi>Ieremies</hi> complaints, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover the fierceneſs of the judgement, and the mighty force it came with, and the quick diſpatch it made, intimates, as if God for that time had abandoned all pity towards <hi>London:</hi> For may not theſe words of <hi>Ieremy</hi> be applied to us, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.10. <hi>He was unto me as a Bear or as a Lion he hath pulled me in pieces, he hath made me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any man that reads theſe things be yet inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the heavineſs of Gods hand in this ſtroke let him beſide; all that hath been ſaid, conſider
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60264:88"/>how unexpected, and how Incredible a thing it was that <hi>London</hi> ſhould be almoſt totally conſumed by fire, ere this year were at an end? Now what, but the greatneſs of this judgement made it ſo incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible till it came? That ſome few houſes might have been fired in a ſhort time, we could eaſily have believed, but not that ſo many as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>The kings of the earth, and the inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the enemy ſhould have entred into the gates of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> To think a judgement too great to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and yet when it is inflicted to make light of it, are very inconſiſtant things, and mighty ſelf-contradictions. He that ſhould have come to a man worth eight or ten thouſand pound, a week before the fire, and told him that within ten days he ſhould not be worth ſo many hundreds, would he not have laugh'd at him, and ſaid in his heart, How can that be? Had all his eſtate been in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſome in one ſtreet, ſome in another, he would never have dream'd that they ſhould be all ſired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or within a few days of one another: And yet it is well known to have been the caſe of many to have been worth a good eſtate one day, and the next day, by the fire to have been reduced almoſt to nothing. How are the words of <hi>Jeremy</hi> upon this occaſion revived, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>They that did feed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately are deſolate in the ſtreets, they that were brought up in ſcarlet imbrace dunghils.</hi> Great and ſudden downfalls cannot but move compaſsion in any man that hath bowels. As <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> Lam. 4.6, 7. <hi>That they who were purer then ſnow, whiter then milk, their viſage was become blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then any coal,</hi> ſo to think how they that lived in great port and faſhion, are many of them, as in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60264:89"/>turning of a hand brought exceeding low, they and theirs, ſhould much affect us. The deſolation of ſo many houſes is a ſad ſight, but the ruine of ſo many families as this fire hath ruin'd, is yet a ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration. Surely it hath fallen heavy, both upon rich and poor, rich men in the loſs of their eſtates, poor men in the loſs of their friends. The rich man hath loſt his talent, and the poor man hath loſt his ſteward that improved it for him in a way of relief and charity.</p>
                     <p>Is it not worth our adding, and throwing into the ballance, that this loſs by fire trod upon the heels of two other greater loſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> By war and peſtilence, the latter of which, not only diminiſhed our eſtates, but (which was worſe) deprived us of near and dear relations: yea, moreover that this judgement came before the other two were gone, or either of them, for is not the ſword yet drawn, and doth not the peſtilence ſtill devour? ſo that theſe three judgements have appeared together like three terrible Comets or Blazing-ſtars threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning utter deſtruction, and God hath come out againſt us riding as it were upon three ſeveral dreadful horſes, black, red and pale, to allude to what is ſpoken in the <hi>Revelations:</hi> And as for what concerns mens eſtates, it is well known that the ſword and peſtilence in ſeveral years hath not ſo much exhauſted them, as this fire did within a few days.</p>
                     <p>Meerly to avoid tediouſneſs I ſhall here add but two things touching <hi>London's</hi> loſs (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe much more might be added) one is, that it is Invaluable, and the other that in the eye of reaſon it is Irreparable. It is in the firſt place Ineſtimable, namely, how great the loſs is for the preſent, but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60264:89"/>more eſpecially what ſad products &amp; conſequences it may draw after it, for the future, whither the tayl of the Comet (as I may call it) may reach. It is a common, and I believe a true ſaying, amongſt the ſufferers by this fire, that they have loſt ſo much that they themſelves cannot tell what they have loſt. Only he that can tell the number of the Stars, and call them all by their names, doth know what the ſum total of this loſs is, and what are all the particulars of it, and what influence this Judgement may have upon the times to come; for certain it is the children which are yet unborn will in time fare the worſe for it. Who can eſtimate how great a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and confuſion will ariſe firſt and laſt from one branch of this loſſe <hi>viz.</hi> the burning of Bills, Bonds, Leaſes, Conveiances, Books of Debts, and Accompts, and other Writings of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which was all that many men had to ſhew for the greateſt part of their Eſtates; what contention and confuſion this one loſs may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no heart can conceive? who knows not that paper and parchment, ſuch as the contents thereof may be, may be of greater value than Pearls and Diamonds? How many had rather, yea had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have loſt thouſands of pounds, than ſome few ſheets of paper, that went to feed thoſe flames? O fire ineſtimably dear! O loſs unvaluable, Could this loſs be repaired the matter were not ſo great, but it either is or ſeems to be irrepairable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now put all theſe things together, and then tell me if his heart be not harder then the nether Milſtone, that can ſee what <hi>London</hi> hath ſuffered, and not mourn with a very great mourning. If ſo a maze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Judgement will not awaken men, they are like to ſleep in their ſecurity, till they come to wake in Hell, where none can ſleep; for the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth continually, and they have no reſt day nor night.</p>
                     <p>But are there any that call themſelves Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that do not only not mourn over, but rejoyce and triumph in the deſtruction of <hi>London?</hi> Let them believe themſelves to be legitimate if they can; at leaſtwiſe let them not think, that others will ever believe that there is one drop of true Engliſh Blood running in their veins: Or let the parents of their Bodies be who they will, I am ſure that in another ſenſe they are of their Father the Devil, and his works they do. If there could have bin mirth in Hell there would have been rejoycing there at the firing of <hi>London,</hi> as there is in heaven at the Converſion of a ſinner. How worthy were they to have dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in thoſe flames, who (if any ſuch be) have ſung and danced at the remembrance of them?</p>
                     <p>But what if ſome not only rejoyce in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, but had the heart to do it? How long was it ere I could believe there was any ſuch Monſter in the World? till I heard of one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed for the ſame, and that by his own ſenſible and perſevering Confeſſion. Lord, What miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60264:90"/>have they done? Is there any ſacrifice for their ſin? One would think, if there were no Hell, God would prepare one on purpoſe, for ſuch miſcreants, to burn them in, who have burn't up the Eſtates and Livelihoods of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. But, Lord, thou knoweſt it is not my deſire they ſhould, nor is it my opinion, that the blood of Chriſt, laid hold on by faith, is not able to ſave their ſouls. And oh! Though their bodies ſhould be given as meat to the fowles of the air, or fewel to temporal flames, yet that their ſouls might be delivered from the wrath to come! Let them rely upon no pardon from that triple crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned blaſphemer of <hi>Rome,</hi> who cannot ſo much as pardon his own ſins, and it is well the (light of ſuch men conſidered, and how they hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe) if they be not unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douable. He that cheats men into ſin, let him not cheat them into Hell, by cauſing them to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mock indulgences, who is eaſie enough to pardon ſuch peccadilloes in his account, as are the burning of Proteſtant Cities, yea, can be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enroll them amongſt his Saints. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a red letter would do well before their names, but onely in token of blood and cruelty. But, Lord, I deſire to look higher, than thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of our late ſire, even unto thee. Thou haſt ſet us on fire round about, and oh that we could lay it to heart as becometh us. We would hold our peace, becauſe thou, Lord, haſt done it. If thou hadſt ſo pleaſed <hi>London</hi> might have been like the Buſh, which did burn, but was not conſumed, but thou didſt give it up to the flames: Lord, at what a rate hath <hi>London,</hi> yea <hi>England</hi> ſinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>VVIth how ſad a heart have I read that Bill, finding but ſixteen Pariſhes within the wals now pretended to, and conſidering with my ſelf by how great a Synecdoche ſome of thoſe Pariſhes do at this day go by their former names? It is that figure, which puts a part for the whole (yea a ſmall part too) the compounding Figure as I may call it, that takes as it were, five ſhillings or half a Crown for a pound) which alone warranteth us to call <hi>London, London</hi> ſtill, and ſeverall pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes (ſaid to be now ſtanding) by the names which they did bear formerly. The unjuſt Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.7. uſed ſubſtraction; onely where a hundred was owing he bid them ſet down fifty, but we (as if that were to be more juſt) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by way of multiplication ſetting down a a hundred for ten or twenty. We view our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as it were through a microſcope, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the leg of a Flea ſo big, as if it were the

So might we call a ſometimes great and ſamous Inne, the Crown or Miter, as it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called, though burnt down to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Cottage, becauſe the ſign and ſign poſt are ſtill to be ſeen, and there is yet ſome ſmall part of the old Building.

I find as many ſorts of diſeaſes in the Bill now as ever. They find men out go whither they will they crowd into Families, that have ſcarce room enough to turn themſelves in.

                     <p>Methinks <hi>London</hi> at this day is a lively Emblem of a Profeſſor fallen from his firſt Love, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a backſliding Profeſſor is juſt in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as <hi>London</hi> is at this day. He goes by the ſame name as formerly, but How far is he from being the ſame perſon he was? How like is he to thoſe Churches the outſides whereof are yet ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; their walls and ſteeples make ſuch a fair ſhow, that they, who ſhould view them at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, would think, they were juſt as before; but alas! Their inſides are gone, they are fit for no uſe, yea their very out-ſides are ſo frail and brittle, that in a windy day men are loth to paſs by them for fear of being knockt on the head. What havock hath ſin made in all the faculties of ſuch men (which, if the Soul may be compared to a City, may be called the ſeveral ſtreets of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) How hath error deſtroyed their underſtandings, ill habits their wills and inclinations to good, the World conſumed their ſpiritual affections, all theſe things conſpired to deſolate and lay
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60264:92"/>waſte their Conſciences; and now thoſe men though called Chriſtians ſtill (and glorying in that name) lie juſt like <hi>London</hi> in duſt, and rubbiſh, and aſhes. O Lord, Give <hi>England</hi> to meet thee in the way of thy judgements, by a timely repentance, yea give theſe three Kingdomes ſo to do, leſt it come to paſs that hereafter <hi>England</hi> ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>England;</hi> and Great <hi>Britain,</hi> Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and the three Kingdomes ſo; by as great a Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, as the poor Remains of <hi>London</hi> are now called <hi>London,</hi> and the Reliques of ſome ſtreets (ſaid to be now ſtanding) by the name thoſe ſtreets had, when in their beauty and glory.</p>

Alas! no, would they ſay that anſwered them, It is ſo far from being out, that it rageth more and more. They that heard it was not out would be asking how far it was gotten, whereabouts it was: Then would men begin to reckon up the Streets and Churches that were burnt down already, <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet is gone, and <hi>Fiſh</hi> ſtreet is gone, and <hi>Gracious</hi> Street is down, and now it is at ſuch a place, and ſuch a place, and ſo they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Is the Fire abated would others ſay? Is there any hope of extinguiſhing it? We ſee little ſign of it would ſome reply, It is ſeared it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the whole City and Suburbs too. Why do
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60264:93"/>they not play their Engines would ſome cry? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las they are broken and out of Kelter, we little expecting ſuch a ſad time as this. Some it may be would ſay, Why do ſo many people ſtand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on, and not run to help? The Fire hath now got ſuch head and is ſo fierce would they ſay that there is no coming near it: But why do they not pull down houſes at a diſtance? that is long work would ſome reply, and ſeeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry away the timber, when they have done, it will do but little good. Do not the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, would ſome ſay, beſtir themſelves to put a ſtop to it? It is like they do what they can, but they are even at their wits ends, or like men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed. They that ſtood and look't on would cry out, See how it burns Eaſt and Weſt at the ſame time, not onely with the wind, but againſt it. Hear how it crackles like a Fire in thorns: Hear what a rattling noiſe there is with the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and falling of timber. Look you there ſaith another juſt now the Fire hath taken this or that Church, which alas is full of goods, now it is juſt come to the Royall Exchange; by and by would they ſay, See how preſently ſuch a ſtately houſe was gone, it was but even now, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fire, and it is conſumed already: Oh what a wind is here, See how it is as bellows to the Fire, or as the breath of the Almighty blowing it up. You would wonder to ſee how far the ſparks and coles doe ſly. It is ſtrange they do not fire all the houſes on the other ſide of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where abundance of them do light. I can think of nothing, ſaith one, but of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morral,</hi> when I ſee this ſight. Alas, Alas! cries one, now do I ſee ſuch a good friends houſe to

Thoſe that were within the City, at that time, would ever and anon ſay to one another, Did you hear that noiſe. There was a houſe blown up, and by and by there was another houſe blown up.

One while they cry there is an order to prevent the coming in of more Carts, it being thought that whilſt we mind the ſaving of our goods, we neglect the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the fire, and now will our houſes and goods burn together, and ſo we ſhall looſe all. Such as had the opportunity to convey their goods, as far as the fields and no farther. How did they diſcourſe of the hardſhip they muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60264:94"/>if they ſhould leave their goods, they would be ſtollen, if they ſhould look to them themſelves (as many had no body elſe to do it for them) they muſt have but little ſleep, and a cold open lodging, and what if it ſhould rain? And ſome we may imagine were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, what they and theirs ſhould do, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and goods being burnt, where they ſhould put their heads as having neither money nor friends, at leaſtwiſe ſo near that they knew how to get to them. Theſe were but ſome of thoſe dreadfull ſtories that men and women talkt of: I could tell you how women with child would ſay, They had but a month or a week to reckon, and this had frighted them almoſt out of their wits, ſo that they found it would go very hard with them. Others again would ſay, They were but ſo many weekes gone, but were ſo diſturbed, that they did never look to go out their full time: Others, it is like, would ſay, They were ſo ill with the fright they had taken, that they thought verily it would kill them, or that they ſhould never come to themſelves whilſt they lived. Would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again report of ſome here and there, who by venturing too much in the Fire, or ſtaying too long to bring away their goods, had loſt their lives and periſhed in the flames?</p>
                     <p>Neither were all ſad diſcourſes exſtinguiſhed with the fire: For ſince that time it hath been the manner of Friends, as they met to ask ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the loſſes each of other. Pray what loſt you, ſaith one, by the Fire? I loſt the houſe I lived in, ſaith one, which was my own, or as good as my own by virtue of a long Leaſe and a great Fine. I loſt my houſes and goods, ſaith another.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60264:94"/>I loſt to the value of two thouſand pounds, ſaith one, I four: I, ſix, ſaith another. I have loſt the one half of what I had ſaith one: I have loſt all ſaith another, I am burnt to my very ſhirt. I have loſt more than all, ſaith a third, for I by this meanes am left in a great deal of debt, that I ſhall never be able to pay, I had many things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to other men committed to me, which are ſwept away. Saith another I am not only undone my ſelf, but ſo many of my Children and near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, it may be all of them are undone by this Fire, as well as my ſelf. But I need to ſay the leſs of this, becauſe every dayes converſe will or may tell us, what men talk ſince the diſmall Fire of and concerning it. O Lord, I ſee thou who canſt put a Song of deliverance into our mouths when thou pleaſeſt, canſt alſo ſill us with complaints and lamentations when thou wilt, and make our own tongues, as it were to fall upon us, how thou canſt make us out of the abundance of our hearts, to ſpeak ſuch things as will terrifie both ourſelves and others, and cauſe both our own ears and theirs to tingle, how eaſily thou canſt find us other diſcourſe than to ask and tell what newes is ſtirring (for who regarded news whilſt theſe things were in agitation) who ſeemed to mind what became of affairs either by Sea or Land? I ſee how eaſily thou canſt imbitter our Converſe one with another, and make us ſpeak ſo as to break each others hearts, that uſe to delight and refreſh each other by their pleaſing conferences and communications, ſo that ſolitude may become leſſe afflictive, than that good company, which was wont to be very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. Would not our tongues riſe up in

Seeing thou haſt thus ſeaſoned our communication, as it were with ſalt, and ſalted it, as it were with fire, ſhall that which is rotten and unſavoury proceed out of our mouths from henceforth? Let us remember, what we ſaid to others, and what others ſaid to us, that we may never be unmindfull of what thou haſt done both to us and them, we have ſpoken with ſad coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances and with aking hearts.

Londoners have been glad ſometimes, if they could get but one in ten of their broken Chapmen, but you, when you ſaw a fire that was

If you had urgent occaſion for money, and ſome biting Uſurer, knowing of it, ſhould make you, directly or indirectly, to pay twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> how would you take on at him, and clamour upon him? Such was your dealing with poor Londoners in the day of their diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>As the raging Sea, when men are in danger of being caſt away, will have a great part of their lading caſt into her lap, or not ſuffer them to ride ſafe; or as Thieves, do make men buy their lives at a great rate, which they ought nevertheleſſe to ſave, and ſuffer them to enjoy free-coſt; or, as the Devil himſelf, when he oſters his aſſiſtance to men in their great ſtraights, exacts that of them for his pains, which is more worth than the whole world, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Souls; requiring to be paid manifold more than his work comes to: Such was the equity you uſed towards diſtreſſed Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in the time of the fire, (as if you had been
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60264:96"/>Jews and they Samaritans.) There was a Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan himſelf, who when he ſaw a ſtranger that had been robb'd, and wounded, and half-dead, had compaſſion on him, bound up his wounds, paid for his lodging, took care of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10 33. Surely you are no akin to that good Samaritan; you took from them whom the fire had robbed before; you made their wounds bleed afreſh with your unkindneſs; you even killed thoſe outright with your cruelty, whom fire, and grief, and fear had made half dead before.</p>
                     <p>Did you ever read that Text <hi>Acts</hi> 28.2. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The barbarous people ſhewed us no little kindneſſe, for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, becauſe of the preſent rain, and becauſe of the cold.</hi> This did Barbarians to ſtrangers, when expoſed but to rain and cold, which is nothing like ſo dangerous as fire: but what you Carters, called Chriſtians, did to men of your own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of your own Religion, the world knows too well; as if you, indeed, had been the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians; and they that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of had been Chriſtians. Will not the Chriſtian-like carriage of thoſe Barbarians judge the barbarous carriage of you Chriſtians (if I may ſo call you)? Have you never read thoſe words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God?</hi> nor thoſe in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Let no man go beyond or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his brother in any matter, becauſe the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi> Quit yourſelves, if you can, from having been Extortioners, and ſuch as have defrauded and gone beyond others. I doubt not in the leaſt, but this was a real theft in the ſight of God: You think it was not, becauſe they conſented and contracted to give you ſo much: But
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60264:97"/>ſo may a man conſent to deliver his purſe to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way man, that threatneth, if he do not ſo, he will have his life: Doth that make it no theft on his part that takes it? A man may conſent to that which is a real injury to himſelf, to avoid a greater than that; all that can be ſaid, is, No man can be forced, if he conſent. <hi>Volenti non fit violentia,</hi> is true, but not <hi>Volenti non fit injuria.</hi> If you have not wronged the poor Citizens, whether with or againſt their conſents (as it was partly both) never were men wronged. How many, think you, did loſe all, or the moſt of their goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had not wherewithall to give thoſe unreaſonable rates which you demanded, who yet could and would have honeſtly paid you as much as you in reaſon and conſcience could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for the removal of their goods. Will not the great God, think you, place the loſs of thoſe goods, and the undoing of thoſe poor fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to your accompt? Therefore, O Countrey men (honeſt Countreymen I muſt not call you till you better deſerve it) let my advice be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you: Bluſh for what you have done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, reſtore, make ſatisfaction to the full. What you have gotten in that way (unleſſe it be ſuch of you as ventured your own lives, or the lives of your beaſts, by going near the fire) will never thrive with you, yea, may prove a moth and canker to all you have beſides. Who were the large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributers to all Briefs, when your Towns and Houſes were at any time burnt, but theſe very Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, whom you have uſed thus unkindly? If fire ſhould happen in your thatch, which may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, (and which you have provoked God to ſend) how dearly would you miſs that City which you
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60264:97"/>have ſo inhumanely oppreſſed? You that have not pitied Londoners, pity your own ſouls; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that true ſaying, Unjuſt gain is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, (that is, forgiven) unleſſe, intentionally by thoſe that cannot, and actually by thoſe that can, reſtitution be made.</p>

How many, under pretence of reſcuing their neighbours goods out of the fire, carried them away for altogether, (as if all things now had been common, becauſe the fire had broken down mens incloſures): Was this your kindneſſe to your friends? Was this the pity that ſhould be ſhewed to them that are in miſery? I have heard indeed of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> (that is, Turkiſh Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers), that when fires have been in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> would ſall to plundering; but, are you Turks? Some living upon the Sea-coaſt, may, perchance, gain now and then by racks, bringing rich goods to their hands; but then, it is preſumed, the owners are caſt away, or cannot be known. They ſay, ſome Nurſes, that uſe to attend on ſuch as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60264:98"/>have the plague, are wont to make away all they can lay their hands on: but then they ſtay, till the people whoſe goods they take, be dead, and have no further need of them.

If you continue to keep them in your Neſts, ſure enough they will ſet them on fire; I mean, they will bring a curſe upon all the reſt of your ſubſtance. You have done that, which one would have thought, no mans heart could ſerve him to have done. If other Thieves deſerve hanging, you are worthy of a Gallows as high as <hi>Haman</hi>'s; for, the circumſtance of time makes your ſin out of meaſure ſinful.

There is a Figure in Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick (and ſuch as we can hardly ſpeak without) which puts things containing, for the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and if the Holy Ghoſt himſelf do uſe that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60264:100"/>Figure, I am ſure we ought not to quarrel with it.

He that ſhall look upon them, but as great ornaments to the places where they ſtood; or, as ſtrong and ſtately buildings, that might have been employed to many good uſes; or at moſt, but as places, where firſt and laſt, many fervent prayers have been offered to God, many religious aſſemblies have met together, many excellent and converting Sermons have been preached, if he be conſiſtent with himſelf, cannot but bewail, that they are now made a ruinous heap. Moſt ſober men do think, there were ſome good and uſeful lights, ſhining to the very laſt, in thoſe Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks; and for their ſakes, I wiſh, (if the will of God had been ſo) that thoſe Candleſticks might yet have ſtood; as alſo for the hope I had, that God in his good time, might have thruſt forth many more faithful labourers into thoſe Vineyards (if I may ſo call them.) Where now within the walls of that, ſometimes famous City, can hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and thouſands meet together, to reap the benefit of one and the ſame Sermon?

What if the blind zeal of Papiſts did build many of thoſe Churches, were they not converted to a better uſe?

Some wanted a heart to buy Books, though they could and ſhould have done it: others bought books enough, but wanted induſtry to peruſe them (and ſo anticipated others that would have read thoſe Books, if they had had them, or could have gotten them) Others both bought Books and read them, but did not too many do it, onely for oſtentation ſake, or out of curioſity (as deſirous to taſte the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge both of good and evill) with deſign meerly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, not to reform and amend themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, or for other ſuch low, and ſiniſter ends? In all this we played the Wantons with our books, and Was it not juſt with God to take them from us, as Parents uſe to take the meat from off their Childrens trenchers, when they ſee, they eat out of meer wantonneſſe?

                     <p>IT is but a few moneths ago, that one, who had never ſeen the <hi>Royall Exchange</hi> before, would have beheld the glory of it with admiration; as one, or more of the Diſciples of Chriſt, did the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem, Matth.</hi> 13.1. ſaying, <hi>See what manner of ſtones and what manner of buildings are here:</hi> But, behold, that which Chriſt ſpake of the Temple, ſaying, <hi>Seeſt thou theſe great buildings! There ſhall not be left one ſtone upon another, that ſhall not be thrown down,</hi> is already almoſt fulfilled in, and upon that ſtately Pile, the deſtruction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we little dream't to have been ſo near at hand. Some ſtones there are yet ſtanding one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſo, as that they muſt be taken down, and had they fallen, without breaking themſelves, it had but ſaved a labour: What a princely ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was that <hi>Royal Exchange?</hi> and of how great uſe? Was not that the Center in which thoſe lines met, that were drawn from all parts of <hi>Europe?</hi> rich Merchants, I mean, and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Tradeſ-men and great Dealers, not onely Engliſh, but Spaniſh, French, Dutch, Portugueze, Danes, Swedes.

As <hi>London</hi> was the glory of <hi>England,</hi> ſo was that <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> one of the greateſt Glories and Ornaments of <hi>London.</hi> There were the Statues of the Kings and Queens
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60264:104"/>of <hi>England</hi> ſet up, as in the moſt conſpicuous and honourable place (as well receiving luſtre from the place where they ſtood, as giving luſtre to it.)</p>
                     <p>How full of Riches was that <hi>Royall Exchange?</hi> Rich men in the midſt of it, rich goods both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and beneath. There men walk't upon the top of a Wealthy Mine; conſidering, what Eaſtern Treaſures, coſtly ſpices, and ſuch like things were laid up in the bowels (I mean the Cellars) of that Place. As for the upper part of it, Was it not the great Storehouſe, whence the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> were furniſhed with moſt of thoſe coſtly things, wherewith they did adorn either their Cloſets or themſelves? Here, if any where, might a man have ſeen the glory of the world in a moment, as the Devil ſhewed it to Chriſt from a high mountain; What artificiall thing could entertain the ſenſes and fantaſies of men, that was not there to be had? Such was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that many Gallants took in that Magazine of all curious varieties, that they could almoſt have dwelt there (going from Shop to Shop, like Bees from flower to flower) If they had but had a Fountain of Money that could not have been drawn dry. I doubt not but a Mahometan (who never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects other than ſenſible delights) would gladly have accepted of that place, and the treaſures of it for his heaven, and have thought there were none like it. About the ſpace of ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>neteen months was that <hi>Royall Exchange</hi> in building, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>June</hi> 7th. til <hi>November</hi> in the year following: So that the Sunne had finiſhed his annual courſe once, and almoſt a ſecond time, ere that work was finiſhed: but was it ſo many hours in bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60264:104"/>as it was months in building?</p>
                     <p>How obnoxious are all earthly things to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? How eaſily are the works of our hands brought to nought? How little a time will ſerve to ruine thoſe things, that did require a long time to raiſe them? I finde this noble Structure had ſtood about a hundred years before Deſtruction over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it: for it is ſaid to have been erected in the year 1566, and the time of its conflagration, we know too well, to have been 1666. One ſixty ſix built it, another ſixty ſix burnt it; ſo one <hi>Philip</hi> founded the Macedonian Empire, another <hi>Philip</hi> ruined it; one <hi>Conſtantine</hi> built <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and another of that Name loſt it; an <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was the firſt eſtabliſhed Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and another <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the laſt. So many times the World goes round like a Circle, where it begins, there it ends. Did that Structure come down in a day or leſſe, which had continued a hundred years, and might in all probability have laſted one Century more? I ſee then there may be more in the womb of one day or night, than was in the womb of a hundred years before, and the law of providence may, in a few hours over-rule the preſcription of a whole Age. Though the deſtruction of Places, and ſo of Perſons ſet out late, yet, when it once ſets out, it may ride poſt, and come, as upon the wings of the wind. <hi>He that, being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed,, Prov.</hi> 29.1. The ſins of that place had deſerv'd this judgment ſooner: but he that bore with the old World, one hundred and twenty years, after warning given, bore with it towards an hundred, though the provocations thereof were great. As nature hath placed the weightieſt things below, and lighter things above
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60264:105"/>them (as Air above Earth); ſo the more ſolid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and parlyes (as well as the more bulky Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities) had wont to be in the lower Rooms of that Exchange, where Merchants met to diſcourſe their affairs. The ſins of that lower part, we may ſuſpect, to have been craft and covetouſneſſe, over-reaching and going beyond one another. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did not ſo becauſe of the fear of the Lord; (as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.5. <hi>So did not I, becauſe of the fear of God</hi>) but others did. And were there not other kinds of ſin, which did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the upper Region of that Exchange, which, like ſo many Comets or blazing Stars, did portend or threaten the deſtruction of it. Oh the pride and prodigality that was there to be ſeen? How few could be charitable, that were ſo expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as many were in that place? And how much of that which was there expended, might well have been put to charitable uſes? How unlikely was it, that they ſhould be humble, who were ſo curious and phantaſtical, as the things that were there bought, ſhewed them to be? They that wrought to that place, had need of as good a phantaſie for Metamorphoſis in Habits, as <hi>Ovid</hi> had in other Things, that they might pleaſe cuſtomers ſo inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able after novelties.</p>
                     <p>So fell that noble ſtructure, undermined by craft and covetouſneſſe, and over-laden with pride and prodigality above, and great was the fall thereof. Though there was in that place an Inſſurance-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which undertook for thoſe Ships and Goods that were hazarded at Sea, either by boiſterous winds or dangerous enemies: yet could it not ſecure it ſelf, when ſin, like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> took hold of the pillars of it, and went about to pull it down.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60264:105"/>What quick work can ſin and fire make? How did that ſtrong Building vaniſh of a ſudden, as if it had been but an Apparition? How quickly was it taken down, as if it had been but a ſleight Tent, the Cords whereof are preſently looſened, and the Stakes ſoon removed? Oh that ſome <hi>Jonas</hi> might have been ſent, to tell us, that within ſo many days that Exchange ſhould be burnt down, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not. Oh that howſoever, a timely repentance might have prevented thoſe ruins; that we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted for our Exchange, by parting with our ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. But ſince it lies in aſhes, and there is no prevention of it, oh that we may not ſo much lament the burning of our Exchange, as the ſins that burnt it. May the minds of men, by this ſad Providence, be diſpoſed to uſe another Exchange, for onely honeſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe; and the minds, both of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to uſe the upper part of it no more as a Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of pride, but, in order to putting them and theirs, into a decent equipage, befitting their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective qualities; and then may they live to ſee another Structure in the ſame place, not inferiour to the firſt, and that <hi>Royal Burſe,</hi> or <hi>Purſe</hi> (which is now a meer <hi>Vacuum</hi>) as well filled as ever it was before; and after that, if the Will of God be ſo, may it never periſh (at leaſt wiſe by fire) more, till the Conſlagration of all things.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>RIghteous art thou O Lord, yet let me plead with thee concerning thy Judgments. Why had the fire a Commiſſion to burn down Hoſpitals? Why didſt thou dry up thoſe pools of <hi>Betheſdah?</hi> Why didſt thou wither the Goards of thoſe poor <hi>Jonas</hi>'s, who had nothing elſe to defend them from the ſcorching of extream poverty? Was ever money given to better uſes, or with a better intent, than what went to the maintaining thoſe houſes of Charity? Or was it ever intruſted in better and ſafer hands, than that which had ſo many perſons of worth and integrity to take care of it, (and be, as it were, Overſeers of, the poor)? Or what charity was ever diſpoſed of more according to the will of the Doners, than that hath always been, which few or none would accept, but thoſe that had need of it (and for them it was intended)? I ſhould have thought, the Doors of thoſe houſes, above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, would have been ſprinkled, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Angel might have paſſed over them, and that Judgment ſhould not have entered, where onely Mercy did ſeem to dwell. Did not Chriſt ſay, <hi>The poor we have alwayes with us,</hi> and ſhall we have no Receptacles for the poor? The poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe daily, but the places of their relief are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; and where thoſe places are yet ſtanding, yet is not much of their Revenue impaired? Shall the Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Aire neſts, but the poor not have where to lay their heads? Came this for their ſakes, whoſe charity
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60264:106"/>did maintain theſe places, or for thoſe that were maintained in them and by them, or for the ſake of others; or for all the three? Whileſt ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to thoſe places out of pure ends and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, might not others do it out of ſuperſtition and conceipt of merit, others out of Oſtentation? (though we may not impute thoſe things to any in particular): And as for thoſe who were relieved in thoſe places, were there not ſins amongſt them alſo? Some, it may be, were not more poor than wicked; ſo, that though their poverty made them the Objects of Mercy from men, yet their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs expoſed them to the Juſtice of God.</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſs, men by ſin, may forfeit, not only their ſuperfluities and conveniencies, but alſo their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſaries, or ſuch things as they cannot live without: and had not too many of theſe ſo done? Though ſome, whoſe miſeries have brought them to ſuch places, are affected with the hand of God, and fear to ſin whileſt his rod is upon them; yet, were there not others, who no whit appalled by all their ſufferings (were it the loſs of limbs or whatſoever elſe) would ſwear, and drink, and rant, at ſuch a rate, as if they had had all the world before them, or thought ſcorn, that as to theſe things, even the greateſt perſonages ſhould go beyond them. Had all been ſuch as ſome were, poſſibly the Great God had not forborn to ſet fire upon thoſe Houſes long ago. But in relation to others, might not this come, Firſt, to try their ſincerity, whether their hearts would ſerve them to give to good uſes, though by this it appears, they can have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of raiſing any laſting monument to their names thereby. Or, Secondly, to try their Faith, whether they would caſt their bread, as upon the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60264:107"/>water, ſo upon the fire, as it were, (or that which may eaſily be burnt) in hope to find it after many dayes. But the probableſt reaſon of all is, that it came to prove and exerciſe their Charity, and to call upon them (ſo many as are able) to <hi>make to themſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that when they fail, they may be received into everlaſting habitations.</hi> Why ſhould the poor be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes maintained by an old ſtock of Charity? Why ſhould not this Age be as charitable as former Ages were? Though many be poor at this time, yet all are not, yea, there are many rich, though not comparative to the number of ſuch as are poor, nor have rich men ever more to do, than when there are moſt poor. Poor men think it a bleſſed thing to receive; but Chriſt hath told them, It is yet a more bleſſed thing to give. The Italians when they begge, uſe to ſay to them of whom they begge, Pray be good to your ſelves.</p>
                     <p>As much as iniquity doth abound, I will not believe, unleſſe I ſee it, that Charity is grown ſo cold, that amongſt all the rich men that are in <hi>England,</hi> Nobles, Gentlemen, and others, there will not be found enough to repair that breach which the fire hath made upon the poor Hoſpitals, and the revenues, formerly belonging to them. You know, (or, if I thought you did not, I can tell you) where and whence you may defaulk e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to rear up thoſe Structures again as large and fair as before, (though one of them was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Pallace of a Prince, even <hi>Bridewell</hi> it's ſelf) and to indow them as liberally as ever, and not to miſſe what you have parted with, when you have done. Think how much extraordinary it uſeth to coſt you every year upon your luſts, one or more.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60264:107"/>One mans Drunkenneſſe coſts him an hundred pounds in a year extraordinary, another mans Uncleanneſſe twice ſo much, a third mans Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſſe, and ſo it is like to do from year to year: Yea poſſibly ſome men have ſpent, as much of their time upon one luſt, as would have built an Hoſpitall. Now as God ſaith, that he <hi>would famiſh all the gods of the Heathen;</hi> ſo do you famiſh thoſe luſts which you have ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, cut off thoſe right hands, that they may graſp no more of your money, for time to come, and let the poor receive it in their ſtead. Is it not better lending to the Lord, than giving to the Devil? Why will you buy repentance ſo dear, when you might put your money to ſo much better uſes? Some that have fallen into very hainous ſins, have built Hoſpitals, for the relief of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
                     <p>God may pleaſe to leave you to the ſame ſins, and ſo extort that out of you, by the ſame means, if it will not come freely. Some, though free from notorious vices, yet do manifeſtly exceed in diet, and in apparel. What if you ſhould leſſen your Table by one or two diſhes every day? What if you ſhould ſpare ſomething of that ſuperfluous coſt, which you uſe to give yourſelves in every gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and reſolving ſo to do, ſhould contribute all that, to the rebuilding and reindowing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed Hoſpitals, which, you reckon, that good husbandry would ſave you every year: What if Gentlemen ſhould keep fewer hounds and hawks, or none at all, in order to ſo good a work? Yea, What if you ſhould put two horſes leſſe into your Coaches, which had wont to be drawn with four or ſix? You may think yourſelves at liberty in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60264:108"/>this caſe, but pardon me, if I think you are bound. It is not matter of choice, but duty, to miniſter to the neceſſities of others, out of our ſuperfluities, and to their extremities, out of our very conveniences. He, that is unmercifull or uncharitable, is alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, becauſe he doth not uſe the talent, wherewith his Lord hath intruſted him, for thoſe ends for which it was put into his hands: He doth not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the juſt will of the Donor: Let it never be ſaid, that God gave you Eſtates to do good with, but you ſpent them upon your luſts, that you can find ſo many pounds, or hundreds of pounds, to conſume in Taverns and Tippling-houſes, ſo much treaſure wherewith to keep Miſtreſſes (otherwiſe called whores) ſo much gold and ſilver, wherewith <hi>to treaſure up to yourſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> but nothing, wherewithal to rebuild, or help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the rebuilding of ruinated Hoſpitals.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>If any think thoſe Halls were built meerly for feaſting and entertainment (or at the moſt but for pompe) they are much deceived. Certainly, they were both intended and improved to higher
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60264:109"/>and better uſes. All great Bodies and Societies of men muſt needs, for order ſake, be divided and ſubdivided. So Armies are divided into ſeveral Regiments; Regiments, into ſeveral Troopes or Companies: ſo Navies divide themſelves into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Squadrons. Upon the ſame accompt, the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> being a great Body of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and thoſe of ſeverall Profeſſions; it was but neceſſary, they ſhould be parcelled into ſeveral Companies, having each of them their peculiar Officers, which made them as it were an entire bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by themſelves, fitted with head and members of all ſorts, the reſpective Maſters being, as it were, the head, the ſubordinate Officers, the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parts, and the ordinary members the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral. Both decency and conveniency required, there ſhould be a handſome place, for each of thoſe Societies to meet in; which was, as it were, a little Parliament Houſe belonging to them, in which the Repreſentatives of each Company (I mean their Officers) did meet together to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and Parley, what might be for the good of the whole. Here the grievances of each Society (falling within their cognizance) where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of and redreſſed. Here they adviſed and agreed together what to do, and what to petition their Superiors for, that might be for the benefit of their reſpective trades and Profeſſions, how they might prevent encroachments and abuſes, how they might maintain their priviledges, how they might take all advantages, for the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their reſpective Trades. In all of theſe a common ſtock was kept on foot, and carefully lookt after, for divers needful purpoſes; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the relief of ſuch of their own Society, as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60264:109"/>ſhould fall to decay, for helping young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who had little to ſet up with, and might there borrow upon good ſecurity, for improving the Eſtates of Widowes (as in the Book-ſellers Company) and for many other good purpoſes; one of which, Schollars ought never to forget, and that is for encouraging young Students, by libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall exhibitions wherewith to increaſe their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance at the Univerſity. There were in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Halls, though not in each of them, Stocks go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all theſe purpoſes (and it is like for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more) which may ſufficiently evidence, that they were places of great uſe; which, I mention to ſhew, what cauſe we have to bewail the loſſe of them. To ſay, they were moſt of them noble Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, even thoſe that did belong to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Trades (as, who ſhould ſay, they aſſumed ſome grandeur to themſelves, as they were a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, whatſoever their condition might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But put all I have ſaid, together (though poſſibly I know not half the uſes they were put to) it will appear a doleful thing, that they were burnt, and that, in their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we loſt, not onely great Splendor, but great conveniences, helps, and advantages, and that in ſeveral kinds. If men did there decree righteous things amongſt themſelves (as I hope they did)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60264:110"/>I know no Crime thoſe places were chargeable with, unleſs it were too much Feaſting: which, the ſadneſs of Times, for many years paſt, might put an aggravation upon: And, if that were all their Crime, I ſee, how neceſſary it is, to ſhun, not only greater, but alſo leſſer ſins, which may expoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and, if Places, Why not Perſons alſo to ruin and deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>One Hall there was of ſomething a different uſe from the reſt, and of greater ſpendor, <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> I mean; in which, one <hi>Author</hi> tells me, no leſs than nine ſeveral Courts had wont to be kept; whereof, one was called, <hi>The Court of Conſcience:</hi> If any of the reſt did not deſerve the ſame name, (which I cannot charge:) thoſe, or that which did not, ſhould be lookt upon as the <hi>Acan</hi>'s, which troubled that place, and brought a curſe upon it. <hi>One ſinner deſtroyeth much good,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.18. What then may not an unrighteous Court do, which conſiſts of many ſinners? When I conſider the Largeneſs, the Strength, and yet the Antiquity, the Majeſty, and the daily-Uſefulneſs of that ſame <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> methinks it is not enough to weep over the Ruines of it: As firm as it ſtood, it was founded no leſs than upward of 360 years agoe; and, to ſee it confounded, (as I may call it) in one day, Whoſe heart would it not cauſe to bleed? Other Halls were like Parliament-Houſes, to particular Companies; but this, to the whole City: where the Aſſembling together of the Lord Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, and Common-Councill, had ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a King, Lords, and Commons. There ſeemed to be an awfulneſs in the very place; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it had a Majeſtick look with it; and ſuch, as made the Magiſtrates there convened (though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60264:110"/>venerable in themſelves) yet ſomething more conſiderable than they would have appeared elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. It was ſurely that place, which did more contribute to make <hi>London</hi> look like it ſelf (that is, like the Head-City of theſe three Kingdomes) than any one Structure thereunto belonging. <hi>London</hi> had not been its ſelf, if it had loſt nothing but that one Hall: I wonder, That all the Wiſe Heads, that were concerned in it, could not ſave that ſtately Hall, (our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Capitol, as I may call it) from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Methinks it ſpeaks our Provocations-high, that we have ſinned away ſo great an Ornament, ſo vaſt an Accommodation as that Hall was; and, to think, that almoſt all the reſt are gone with it, might make our <hi>joynts tremble,</hi> and our <hi>knees ſmite together,</hi> as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s did, when he ſaw the <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing upon the wall.</hi> I ſee there is no building cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly durable, but that, which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. and, Lord, let that be mine (as well as his,) <hi>That building of God, that houſe not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IS Learning taking it's leave of <hi>England?</hi> Is that Sun about to ſet in our Horizon? that Schollars have received two ſuch terrible blows? Young ones have loſt their Schools; and, both young and old have loſt their Books: Nevertheleſs, for ever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned be Reverend Doctor <hi>Colet,</hi> and the reſt of the Founders and Benefactors of all thoſe noble Free-Schools that now lie in the duſt: I ſay, Let
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60264:111"/>their Memory be ever precious, though their Gift hath not continued ſo long, as they and we did hope it might. Yet, the youngeſt of the three Publick Schools, that are now demoliſhed (<hi>viz.</hi> that which was founded by the <hi>Merchant-Taylers</hi>) had laſted above a hundred years; and the eldeſt of the three. (<hi>viz. Paul</hi>'s) half as long again, and many Centuries more they might have ſtood, had not this fire brought them to an untimely end. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but muſe to what a plunge Parents are now put, to get good Schools for their Children, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe, who cannot endure their Children ſhould live at a diſtance from them) conſidering, that honeſt and able School-maſters are but here and there to be found. A good School-maſter muſt, in the firſt place, be a good man: It is to a wonder what notice Children will take of their Maſter's Religion, and what a laſting impreſſion that will make upon them; and how apt they are to take after them, becauſe of the veneration they have for them. If their Maſters be profane, they think they have leave to be ſo, and ſhould not take upon them to be more religious than they. A Maſter muſt conſider, that his Scholars have ſouls to ſave, as well as minds to inform; and he is not to be truſted with Youth that will not conſider it. Nextly, A good Maſter muſt be a good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, (at leaſt wiſe for ſome kind of Learning) a good Grammarian, a good Linguiſt; and one, that is not only ſo himſelf, but alſo able to make others ſuch, that is, one that knows how, in an eaſie and familiar way, to communicate Knowledge to Children, to make hard things plain, &amp;c. He muſt be <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Again, A good Maſter muſt be a wiſe man, no antick, no mimmick (as too many are, which hath made the word <hi>Pedant</hi> and <hi>Pedantical</hi> to ſound very ridiculouſly, though the work of a good School-maſter be very honourable). Wiſe he ought to be, that he may ſet his Scholars the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a wiſe behavior, and teach Children to carry themſelves like Men; whereas, ſome ſeem to learn of their Scholars to carry themſelves like Children, that is, Conceiptedly, Humorſomely, Phantaſtically. It requires no ſmall Wiſedom, to judge of the different parts and tempers of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, where their excellency lies, whether in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or Invention, or otherwiſe, that they may put them upon thoſe pieces of Learning, in which they are like moſt of all to excell: and whileſt they find them to have an excellency in one kind, work upon that, and bear with their defects in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind. He may have a great Memory, that hath but mean Fancy; he may be long in retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who is ſlow in getting things into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; one can make his exerciſe of a ſudden, as well as if he had more time; another can do nothing of a ſudden, but, give him time enough, and he will perform it excellently, and better than he that was quick at it.</p>
                     <p>How many Maſters commit great errors, for want of being able to judge of theſe things, like unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Riders, that either think a horſe good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing becauſe he cannot amble well, though he have an excellent and an eaſie tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60264:112"/>him leave. The Scholar's Scholar-craft, (as I may call it) in humoring his humorſome Maſter: the Parent's great bounty to the Maſter, and his great affection to ſuch his Scholars, upon thoſe two accounts, makes too many partial and injudicious Maſters, Cry up the pregnancy of thoſe Scholars that little deſerve it, and ſo <hi>vice verſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.</hi> And ought not Maſters to be wiſe therefore alſo, that they may be able to judge of the diſpoſition of their Scholars, whether fair means or fowl is like to do moſt good upon them, whether fear or ſhame will moſt prevail with them, whether emulation or correction will moſt ſpur them on. A word or two will do more with ſome Children, than many blows with others; where Balſomes will ſerve the turn, it is folly to apply Cauſticks and Corroſives, which, it is to be feared, ſome Maſters do for want of judgment. Moreover, wiſe and ſage Admonitions are of great uſe to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and therefore, it is needful, their Maſter ſhould be a wiſe man, that he may be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe them Let me add, A Maſter had need be furniſhed with Wiſedom, to govern and conceal his own weak humors and paſſions (as there are many that abound with ſuch) for that the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof, is like <hi>Noah</hi>'s uncovering his nakedneſs, in the ſight of his Children, which expoſed him to their contempt, and made ſome of them to ſin: And Maſters that give way to ſuch humors, are like unſound Nurſes that give ſuck, who make the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that draw their Breaſts as unwholſome as themſelves; and fill them, as they ſay, with evil hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. I might add, That a Maſter ſhould be no conceited man, not one that thinks himſelf a good Philoſopher, becauſe he is a good Philologer; or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60264:112"/>the wiſeſt man in the Nation, becauſe he is the wiſeſt perſon in the School: He that is a Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Children, may be but a Child amongſt Men. I had not mentioned this, but that I have obſerved ſome School-maſters, to have brought an ill report, both upon themſelves and their Profeſſion, by ſeeming as wiſe in their own eyes, as they could be in the eyes of their boyes, who oftimes think, that no man knows ſo much as doth their Maſter, as if they were proud of that high opinion, which their Scholars have of them, and did reſt in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Children (who ſcarce know the right hand from the left,) as if it were infallible.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, To ſay nothing of that diligence and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſneſs that ought to be in School-maſters, I ſhall only add, that they ought not to be either too milde or ſevere, neither like that Beam, which <hi>Jupiter</hi> (as it is in the Fable) gave to the Frogs for their King: Which alwayes lying ſtill, when they were uſed to it a while, they leapt and plaid upon it: Nor yet like that Stork, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſent amongſt them, when they deſired a more active Prince, whoſe cruelty made them wiſh for their Beam again. He, that is over-mild, is like to do little good upon ſome children; but, he that is over-harſh, may do a great deal of hurt. I read, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.9. of the <hi>School of one Tyrannus:</hi> I wiſh there were no more Schools that did deſerve the ſame name. We hear but of one Tyrannical Emperor that became a School-maſter before he died; but, Are there not many School-maſters that domineer, and exerciſe ſeverity like Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Emperors, or Imperial Tyrants? Now, if the character I have given of a good School-maſter be a Digreſsion; yet, it may prove a uſeful one, if

                     <p>But poſſibly, what I have ſaid about School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, is no Digreſſion, conſidering, that if thoſe Maſters that were fired out of <hi>London,</hi> were men of ſuch a good Character, as I have given of a good School-maſter, it informeth us what cauſe we have to bewail the loſſe of them, and of thoſe Schools which might have invited and incouraged a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſuch worthy Maſters as themſelves. This poor Lads little lay to heart (as being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what is for their good); yea posſibly, what through dread of their Maſters, disaffection to their Books, and love of their Play, they are even glad their Schools are burnt; ſo incident it is to humane nature, to rejoyce in any little good to it's ſelf: yea, to wiſh for it, though it be brought to paſſe by unſpeakably more hurt and prejudice to others; being glad, when their own eggs are roaſted, though it be by that fire, that conſumes the houſes of other men. Yet I wonder not, at the evil that proceeds from degenerate men, much leſſe from Children: but, O Lord, I rather wonder at Thy ſelf, Why thou didſt ſuffer the Foxes to ſpoil thoſe Vines (the Fire, I mean, which came like <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Foxes, with fire-brands in their Tails, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming thoſe Noble Schools, as they did the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtim</hi>'s Corn,) conſidering, that <hi>thoſe Vines had tender Grapes,</hi> Cant. 2.15.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60264:114"/>ſhould give it them? But oh that theſe uſeful Structures might not alwayes lie in the duſt, but that Piety and Charity might rebuild what Sin hath pull'd down. Doubtleſſe, this Age hath many men in it, as able to build Free-Schools, as Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Colet,</hi> and ſome other Founders were; and why ſhould they not be as willing. If Parents want good Schools for their Children, they will hardly come to any thing whilſt they live: (For, the errors of the firſt Concoction, as Phyſicians obſerve, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be corrected by the ſecond or third). Schools, like Stomachs, make the firſt Digeſtion, which if naught, will ſpoil all the reſt. Let me conjure men of Eſtates, eſpecially thoſe that have no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or if Children ſuch as are unworthy, I ſay, let me conjure you, by the regard you have to the honour of God, to the renown of the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the increaſe of Knowledge, to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Church and State, (the chief Officers and Miniſters whereof, uſe to receive their firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſeaſoning in publick Schools) liberally to contribute to the re-building of thoſe noble Schools, which the late ſire hath deprived us of; yea, do it yourſelves, as ſome have done before you, if you have wherewithall: And when that is done, ſet up your Statues by thoſe of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Founders, and appear together like <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> at Sea, which is accounted an Omen of good.

                        </gap> I have been intruſted with: Oh the vaſt concernment of ſuch Papers and Parchments as theſe! What had not many rather have loſt than theſe? How many were honeſt and juſt in all their Accompts, who now want an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make it appear they were ſo? (and, Doth not that wound them ſorely?) How many dealt falſely and fraudulently in the truſt that was committed to them, and that cannot be proved neither? Doleful fire! that hath made honeſt men mourn, and knaves rejoyce. With what coſt and care were many of thoſe Writings drawn up at firſt? How oft were the owners at Counſel about them? and, With how much circumſpectneſs was every Clauſe put in? but, Did the ſire make any more of them then if they had been ſo much waſte paper? Deeds and Conveiances were no more to thoſe flames than chips, and ſtraw, and ſtubble: How ſlight is that Tenure, by which men do hold and enjoy all their Earthly Poſſeſſions? How ſoon may that, which ſhould defend their title, be ſtoln, or burnt, or otherwiſe loſt? and then, How liable are they to be claimed by thoſe that have no right? Was there ever ſuch a plucking up of Incloſines as this, whereby the Eſtates of many are, as it were, laid common, that is, obnoxious unto being inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and over-run by them that will.</p>
                     <p>It is well, a Chriſtians evidences for heaven are not ſo uncertain: It is true, that coppy of them which is within his own breaſt, may be loſt, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, at leaſtwiſe for a time; but then there is a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60264:117"/>counter-part of them kept in heaven, which can never be loſt: for, <hi>The foundation of God ſtands ſure, and he knoweth who are his.</hi> It is happy for us that uncertain things are thoſe of leſs value; but, that thoſe things which are moſt valuable, (though indeed only they) may be aſcertained and inſured in heavenly things. Sad was the loſs of Writings, as they were Evidences of mens Eſtates; but, methinks more ſad, as they were the Vouchers of mens honeſty: or, if by this meanes, either honeſt men become ſuſpected, or, thoſe that have been otherwiſe cannot be detected and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But, methinks, where alwayes heretofore found faithful, it is but equal to admit no jealouſie of them upon this occaſion. No doubt, but he, that was faithful till the fire, will be faithfull after it, and not be worſe for that Purgatory (if I may ſo call it.) O Lord, Art not thou he that didſt find out a way to acquit thoſe chaſt Women that were ſuſpected of Adultery, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.28? Art not thou he who didſt furniſh <hi>Solomon</hi> with wiſdom, to know which was the true Mother of the living child, to which two Women laid an equal claim, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3? Art not thou he that didſt direct Queen <hi>Emma</hi> and others to paſſe the hot plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares bare-foot and blind-fold, without hurting her ſelf; when, by that ardent fire, proof was to be made of her unſpotted chaſtity? Clear up. I beſeech thee, the integrity of thy innocent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whoſe Accompts and Acquittances this fire hath deſtroyed: but, as for others, ſearch out their wickedneſs till thou find none; or, as thou ſaidſt, thou wouldſt <hi>ſearch Jeruſalem with candles,</hi> Zeph. 1.12. What work hath this burning of Writings made for greedy Lawyers? What a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60264:117"/>are they like to have by that means? One ſire, I doubt, will beget another, <hi>viz.</hi> that of endleſs contention, and Law-ſuits: Now the ſire hath gotten mens Vintage; I wiſh, unjuſt Claimers on one hand, and Lawyers on the other, do not ſweep awar their Gleanings: They are newly leapt out of the fire, and, Moſt they preſently come into the frying-pan? Can the wiſdom of our Governors find out no way whereby to prevent vexations Suits, that will otherwiſe ariſe upon this occaſion, to preſerve the rights of honeſt men, now their Writings are gone; and, to prevent the unjuſt claims of thoſe that are diſhoneſt?

                     <p>HOw long was this goodly Cathedral in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? How leaſurely did it proceed? Inſomuch that it became a Proverb, when men did any thing ſlowly, That they made <hi>Pauls</hi>-work of it: But ſo did not the fire, when it came to deſtroy it, but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60264:118"/>conſumed it preſently, as if it had been but <hi>Jonas</hi> his gourd, which ſprang up in a night. Dying Perſons are oft-times very reſtleſs, they ſhift from one ſide of their beds to the other, and talk much of removing to other places. So, have I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this noble Structure, not long before its fatal period, to have ſhifted often. Firſt it was a Church, then a Stable (as ſome were pleaſed to make it) within theſe few years (but the argument was far fetcht, if, they think, that becauſe Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did ſometimes lie in a Stable and in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that therefore, one and the ſame place might well ſerve, both for brutiſh and for ſacred uſes) Otherwhile (if not at the very ſame time) it was made a Court of Guard (without any intention, as I believe, to make it an Emblem of the Church Militant, or to exhibit any other religious myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.) And then of late, it wheel'd about again to its Primitive uſe, to be a place appropriated to Divine Worſhip. Few expected it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long a Stable, or a Court of Guard (for great alienations, like ſtrong ſticks that are much bent, do quickly ſtart back again) but, when it became once more a Church, they that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it had ſtood above five hundred years, from its firſt Erection (yea, and Conflagration) which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was in 1087. after which it was ſoon built again, and did obſerve it to bear its years well, (as if it were at moſt but of a middle age) ſaw no cauſe to doubt, but it might laſt as much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But alas! How were they deceived? and How was its deſtruction at the very door! Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Papiſts are deceived, in thinking Crucifixes to carry a ſafeguard and protection with them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that this Cathedral was built in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60264:118"/>of a Croſs, and yet, when Fire did appreach, had no relief by it. It had been a comfortable ſight, to have beheld the firſt erection of that ſtately Church, conſidering the Scituation and Dedication of it, that whereas before, in the ſame place, ſtood a Temple Dedicated to <hi>Diama</hi> (and as is ſuppoſed, a Wood and Grove about it, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her uſe) there was then another in the room of it; the name whereof might ſpeak the place alienated from heatheniſm to Chriſtianity, from the ſervice of a falſe goddeſſe, to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the true God, and of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Twice hath that famous Structure been fired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (at leaſtwiſe part of it) both times by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and thereunto expoſed by the tranſcendent height of its Steeple. One of thoſe times it burnt a great part of the City of <hi>London</hi> (if I miſtake not;) and now, the City, by a kind of unintended retaliation hath helpt to burn it. Great pity it is to ſee ſo noble a building in the duſt, and yet it is likely ſome will but little pity it, if not rejoyce in the ruins of it (eſpecially its diſaffected neighbours, whoſe houſes that had wont to lean to the ſides of it (like Vines climbing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wall) had at leaſtwiſe received ſentence to be pulled down.) But ſhould not men regard the honor of their Nation, whatſoever became of private intereſts?</p>
                     <p>One ſtrange and remarkable paſſage that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to this Cathedral, I cannot but reflect upon, <hi>viz.</hi> The unheard of continuance of a certain dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body of one Dr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60264:119"/>inform, was taken up ſince this fire, and found to retain much of it's manly ſhape, and moſt of it's external parts, to the amazement of ſuch as beheld it, and did withall believe it to be indeed the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the ſaid Biſhop. I ſhall not diſpute, whether the dignity of his Perſon, as he was ſometimes a Biſhop, or as he was ſometimes Lord Chancellor, or as he was both at once, were that which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign over his Body to ſo long an incorruption, (as if Corruption and Worms had been afraid to claim kindred of him, as of others): but, I think, rather than either, that this came to paſſe to ſhew the power of God, as to preſerving Bodies from Corruption in the Grave, as well as thoſe of the three Children, from being conſumed in the fiery Furnace; and that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> from being devoured by the Lions, when he was in their Den.</p>
                     <p>But whilſt this paſſage miniſtreth great wonder to all that ſee and hear of it, What is himſelf the better for it? For, had his Body been eaten by Cannibals, thoſe Cannibals by Fiſhes, thoſe Fiſhes afterwards by Men, thoſe Men by Worms, yet, ſhould it have been brought forth as perfect, at the Reſurrection of the Dead, as now it is; yea, as it was then, when it was firſt committed to the Grave.</p>
                     <p>Now, as for re-building of that Cathedral, when I conſider, how many Sons that Mother hath had, who in all Ages have been as kind and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to her, as could be deſired; I doubt not, but the ſame principles and affections which led them to it in her proſperity, will prevail with them to be the ſame, now ſhe lieth in the duſt; commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration towards her, and conſideration of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>England,</hi> ſtepping in as further incentives
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60264:119"/>thereunto. May <hi>England</hi> (if the will of God be ſo) enjoy ſo much peace and plenty, and all the living Temples of God be ſo well provided for, that none may grudge that coſt and charge, which is neceſſary to re-building Churches; not onely ſuch, and ſo many, as may ſerve for indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe, but neither that alſo, which may rear up others, not only for uſe, but ſuch as may be alſo, an outward honour and ornament both to the Church and Nation.</p>

                     <p>IT is a great diſpute, amongſt many people, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men (one or more) had any hand, from firſt to laſt, in the burning of <hi>London.</hi> They that are for the affirmative, think they have much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on their ſide, becauſe one was, by Order of Law, executed upon that account; and the proof againſt him, no leſſe than his own Confeſſion (both in publick and private) in which he long perſiſted, though he knew full well the danger of it. Now, who but a mad man, would confeſs himſelf guilty, of ſo hainous and odious a crime which he had never committed? And on the other hand, had he been mad, his Judge and Jury wanted not wiſedom and diligence ſufficient, by one means or other, to diſcover it: neither had they ſo little Juſtice and Conſcience, as to have convicted and condemned him, for ought he had ſaid againſt himſelf, if it had been evident to them, he had not been himſelf, or, as they call it, <hi>Mentis Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos.</hi>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60264:120"/>Moreover, ſay they, This muſt needs have been done, either by Over-ſight, or by Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or by Miracle. We hear not of the leaſt um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of any over-ſight, or careleſſneſſe in any of the Family where the fire began, (which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hath been narrowly lookt into): ſo that if we reject the ſecond, we muſt reſt in the third, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was done by a miraculous, that is, by an immediate Hand of Heaven, which, ſince the time that miracles have generally ceaſed, ſeems far leſs probable, than it is, that that ſhould be true, which a man, that, for ought could be made appear, was in his right wits, did confeſſe againſt his own life.</p>
                     <p>But grant it were ſo, that the firſt fireing of any part of <hi>London,</hi> were wilfully done, by that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Wretch, who took it upon himſelf and was executed for it, Will it follow from thence, that the Hand of God was not viſible upon it? Yea, all things conſidered, if <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians had been then alive and preſent, they would have ſaid, <hi>This was the Finger of God,</hi> as they ſaid in another caſe, when it was undeniable. For, firſt of all, Who but the great God, withheld Rain for ſo many weeks before, and ſent ſo great a Drought, as did make the houſes ready to take fire, like ſo much Tinder? Who brought the wind out of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and made it blow ſo fiercely for ſeveral days together, as if it had been on purpoſe to augment and ſpread thoſe flames like mighty bellows? Who that had begun that ſire, could foreſee the wind would continue ſo long to carry on his work, and not ſuffer thoſe flames to be extinguiſhed as other fires have been? Who dried up the Springs, that when men came to dig for water in ſeverall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60264:120"/>Streets, little could be had, where uſed to be plenty at other times? By whoſe Providence came it to paſſe, that the Engines, which uſed to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in ſuch caſes, were at that time, moſt of them out of kelter, and unfit for uſe? Who took away ſpirit and courage from men, that they were at that time (above all the reſt) like ſilly Doves without heart, and, contrary to their uſuall manner, did generally apply themſelves, not to extinguiſhing the fire, but unto removing their goods, (even ſuch as were competently remote) as if they had given all for loſt at the firſt daſh. Who hid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell from mens eyes, that ſo obvious and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a way, as that of Blowing up of houſes to ſtop the increaſe of fire, was not ſooner thought of? Or, if it were, that it was no ſooner put in Execution? I ſay, Who but the great God did all theſe things? Who cauſed the fire to burn fiercely, as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wind as with it? Diſown Providence in this, and you will diſown it every where. If there were ſomething of the hand of man in it, doubtleſſe, there was more of the hand of God.</p>
                     <p>But yet, more do they intitle the Providence of God to this ſire, who ſeem conſident, there was nothing of Treachery or Deſign in it. For, if they think it came in an ordinary way (but unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedly); things that ſo happen, are in Scripture more eſpecially put upon God's account. It is ſaid of him that killed a man accidentally, and without any purpoſe ſo to do, that <hi>God had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him into his hands,</hi> Exod. 21.13. Moreover, when things that come by accident, or, without humane contrivance, ſo fall out, as if all things had been laid and prepared for ſuch a purpoſe, in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60264:121"/>ſuch caſes the Divine Providence is moſt viſible and conſpicuous. Now manifeſt it is, that if a Councill of Jeſuits had laid their heads together, how they might burn <hi>London</hi> to the ground, they could not have choſen, either a fitter time, or place. Not a fitter time, in reſpect of the great Drought that had been, and wind that then was; nor yet a fitter place, conſidering the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it, to the great magazine of Combuſtible Materials, to wit, Pitch, Tar, Oils, Hemp, and Powder it's ſelf: (viz. <hi>Thames</hi>-ſtreet). More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, how near was it to the Water-houſes, the burning down of which places, was juſt like a ſubtle Enemy his ſeizing upon ſome conſiderable Forts, which might otherwiſe ſtand in his way, and obſtruct his deſign. It makes me think of what is ſpoken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.50. how that <hi>God did make a way to his anger,</hi> as if he would have nothing to hinder the paſſage of it: And, upon the whole, I cannot but recount thoſe words of God, by his Prophet, to the Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Behold, I frame evil againſt you, and deviſe a device againſt you:</hi> for methinks it appeareth like a Deſtruction wiſely framed and deviſed.</p>
                     <p>But, as for ſuch, as think it came neither by Treachery, nor by Caſualty, they muſt needs aſcribe it to meer Providence, and to nothing elſe; not onely to God, but to God alone, like the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> or, of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah.</hi> So that, let men derive the pedigree of this fire whence they will (as there are three conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures about it) they cannot exclude the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God from having ſignally appeared in it. It is a ſign the great God is not aſhamed of what he hath done, and that he cares not who knows it:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60264:121"/>For, how eaſie had it been for him, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the burning of <hi>London</hi> in ſuch a way, as that himſelf might ſcarce have been ſeen in it, that men would generally have thought, it had been the hand of Man, and not of God, any more than every thing elſe is: But now, methinks it is, as if the great God had ſaid, If any man ask, Who ſet <hi>London</hi> on fire? let the Circumſtances tell them, it was I, that did it.</p>
                     <p>Surely, ſomething is the matter, that God ſhould, as it were, glory, in making known, that he it was that ſet <hi>London</hi> on fire: Was it not to ſhow, that he had a Controverſie with us? Might it not be alſo, leſt his governing of the World ſhould be called in queſtion, if ſo great a thing ſhould have hapned, to all appearance, by meer chance and fortune? Was it not alſo to make us ſtoop, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſo great a loſs, upon ſuch an accompt, as <hi>David</hi> did, when he ſaid, <hi>I held my peace, becauſe thou Lord didſt it:</hi> Or, Might it not be alſo, to tell us, That he challengeth to himſelf juſt Power and Authority, to burn up great Cities at his pleaſure; and, <hi>Who ſhall ſay unto him, what doeſt thou?</hi> As <hi>Lebanon</hi> is ſaid, not to be ſufficient for him to burn; ſo neither was <hi>London</hi> more than ſufficient: O <hi>London,</hi> Diſdain not to fall by that hand by which thou art fallen: It was not that poor Miſcreant, that ended his dayes at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> that did, or could, by his own power deſtroy thee (though poſsibly he may be ſomewhere Canonized for the Saint that did it.) If God had not firſt dried thee, he, and a hundred more, could never have burnt thee: If he kindled the fire, it would have gone out again, if God had not blowed the coal: It was he that ſaith, <hi>Behold, I ſhake heaven and earth:</hi> It is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60264:122"/>he that can take hold of the Pillars of the Univerſe, and tumble it down when he pleaſeth: It is he, that in proceſſe of time, will ſerve the whole World as he ſerved thee: It was he, I ſay, that bid thee come down and lie in the duſt. Humble thy ſelf under his mighty hand; He can raiſe thee up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>and make thee a Princeſſe among the Nations,</hi> when <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> may chance to lie in Aſhes.</p>

Who dare, or who truly can, in this caſe, apply thoſe words of <hi>Solemon, Eccleſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>I ſaw under the Sun the place of Judgment that Wickedneſſe was there, and the place of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that Iniquity was there?</hi> For amidſt all the complaints of men about other matters, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſtaſtes they have taken at particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or paſſages, I do not know that man, that will deny, that there is as much of Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be found amongſt the Reverend Judges, which are at this day, as amongſt the Judges of any Time and Age whatſoever: The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, may be no ſmall comfort to the poor Citizens, whoſe difficult Caſes, relating to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60264:122"/>the fire are like to lie in their breaſts, and be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to their wiſe determination (which, I hope, will be ſuch, as may abundantly confirm that honourable Character, which I think, but juſtice to give concerning them).</p>
                     <p>Yet was that honourable and moſt eminent place of their Seſſions, within the City burnt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt. How commodious was that place for their work; for that it was ſcituare near to the great Den of Theeves, and Receptacle of Felons: (<hi>Newgate</hi> I mean) it being requiſite, that Juſtice and Sin ſhould not dwell far aſunder, but, that the former ſhould, as it were, tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heels of the latter. From thence had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Malefactors received ſentence to be deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed, but now the place itſelf, which (for what cauſe we know not) had received an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſentence in heaven, had it executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and came to an untimely end, yet had it ſtood ſo long, as to acquire the name of Old, being called the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and, as one Author thinks, was a Court of Juſtice, for ſome purpoſes above three hundred years ſince, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1356. And what more than Old or very Old can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to any Creature upon earth, in point of duration, none of which, in this world, ſhall be perpetual (for that is more than the world it ſelf ſhall be.) The Apoſtle telling us, that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved. When places of Juſtice are deſtroyed, perhaps Malefactors will rejoyce, (though they have little cauſe; for change of place will no whit mitigate their puniſhment) but all true and honeſt men will be ſorry. May there nere want a place, in which to try and arraign Malefactors (in caſe there be any ſuch) but much
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60264:123"/>rather do I wiſh, there might no more be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Malefactors deſerving to be tried.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>COncerning thoſe, that uſe an after care, and provide too late, our Proverb is, <hi>That when the Steed is ſtolen, they ſhut the Stable door:</hi> but the fire, when it had ſtollen the Steed, I mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the City, ſlung open the Gates, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demoliſhed and ruinated ſeverall of them. (Gates without a City being as inſignificant, and to as little purpoſe, as a City without Gates is unſafe.) Yet had thoſe Gates been ſtanding, which are not (I mean in ſtrength and perfection) it might have carried a good Omen and Preſage with it, as if they had been left to encloſe and ſecure a City, which ſhould afterwards be built (though there were ſcarcely any for them to ſecure at preſent;) but we truſt through divine goodneſs, the ſame thing will be done (but with more charge) without that Omen. No man can tell where deſtruction will begin or where it will make an end, for that ſometimes it makes an end, where uſually it begins. Deſtruction uſually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults the Gates of a City firſt, and then the City it ſelf; the loſs of the Gates doth generally prove the loſing of the City: but, in this caſe, the loſing of the City firſt, proved the loſs of the Gates at laſt: The fire went out of the City by the Gates, but it came not in that way. There are famous Gates for Death and Miſery to enter in by, which are all
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60264:123"/>we look at, generally; and, if they be but ſhut, we think our ſelves ſecure; (alaſs! but too ſecure are we in one ſenſe, for thinking ſo,) ſith Death and Miſery have ſo many ſecret in-lets which we know not of; and can make a way, where they ſcarce find any. We thought, if <hi>London</hi> had been deſtroyed, (as now it is,) it muſt have been by ſome powerful enemy, viſibly entring in at its Gates; but, little did we think of what one ſpake in another caſe; That, there was <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, ſome ſuch inviſible evils, or enemies within us, as were ſufficient to deſtroy it in this faſhien: Alaſs! When can we conclude our ſelves ſafe in this World?</p>
                     <p>Beſides that great Ornament which thoſe ſtately Gates, that were burnt, added to the City, and the great Defence which they afforded thereunto, (as to enemies from without,) Were they not alſo very ſerviceable, as they were the fitteſt places, in reference to their impregnable ſtrength, whereof to make Goales and Priſons; (neither are there any Houſes more neceſſary than they,) ſo long as there are many lewd People, whom no other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but ſuch can keep within compaſs; for whom Priſons are as needful, as Chimneys are for fire: which, ſet at liberty, would put all into a ſlame: But now came an unexpected Goal-delivery, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to many poor Priſoners, than they looked for: but, to Capital-Offenders not ſo good, as it is like, they did hope it would have proved. When no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Felons heard of this, probably they did hope, it would break open the doors of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Priſons, and ſet them free: but, all they got by it, was, only a Newer <hi>Newgate,</hi> or to be removed from one Goal to another: But, poor Men, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60264:124"/>were in for Debt only, as in <hi>Lud-gate,</hi> &amp;c. poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they were in a pannick-fear they ſhould have been burnt in the Priſons where they were, not knowing how to make an eſcape: But, if I miſtake not, they were releaſed in the time of the fire, which had left but room enough for Offenders of a higher nature: So was the Proverb verified, that, <hi>It is an ill-Wind that blowes no body any good:</hi> So was the Fire more merciful to them than their Creditors: ſo were their fears converted into joy. Is it not worth mentioning, How that <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>-fire did firſt roaſt, and then devour thoſe Quarters of human fleſh, which upon thoſe Gates were expoſed to the Fowls of the Air; robbing them of their prey, and burying them in the duſt much ſooner than was expected: Now may it be ſaid, That the Gates of <hi>London,</hi> as of old, That the Gates of <hi>Sion</hi> did mourn. VVe little thought the time had been ſo near, when the Security of <hi>London</hi> ſhould not conſiſt ſo much in its Gates and VValls, (I ſay, its Security, as from a forraign Enemy: for, <hi>Nullus ad amiſſas ibit opes,</hi>) as in its un-enviable Ruins and Pove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is evident by Scripture, that the <hi>Heavens and the earth</hi> (which are now) <hi>are reſerved unto fire againſt the day of Judgement,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.7. And, <hi>That in the day of God</hi> (as it is called,) <hi>the heavens, being on fire, ſhall be diſſolved; and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat,</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>Yea, the heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe; the earth alſo, and the works
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60264:124"/>that are thereof ſhall be burnt up,</hi> Verſ. 10. Some think, that fire ſhall only refine, and purifie, not conſume and deſtroy: But, beſides that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the <hi>heavens</hi> their <hi>being diſſolved, and paſsing away;</hi> and that of the <hi>earth,</hi> its being <hi>burnt up,</hi> ſeem to import more, than a bare purifying of both, or either of them: Why ſhould we think the World it ſelf ſhould laſt, when all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of it ſhall be removed into another World? Surely, the World will be of no further uſe, when there ſhall be no one Man or Woman to Inhabit it, and to adore God in, and for it: God made the World for Mans uſe, and therefore will unmake it again, when Man hath no further uſe for it; (as Men uſe to pull down Tents, when they have no further occaſion for them.) The World is but Gods Nurſery, (ſuch a thing I mean as <hi>Gardiners</hi> uſe to call by that name,) from whence he means to tranſplant all he there ſets; and, when that is done, he will pull down his ſences, and let it run to ruin: Yea, he will lett-in fire as a wild Bore, that ſhall deſtroy it. Whoſoever believes that God made the World, cannot but think he is able to deſtroy it; for that it ſeems much eaſier of the two, to bring ſomething to nothing, than to bring ſomething out of nothing. What a ſolemn time will that be, when the whole world ſhall be in flames? What a petty, puny fire was that which burnt up <hi>London,</hi> to that which ſhall conſume the whole world? For what was <hi>London</hi> to <hi>England?</hi> What is <hi>England,</hi> in compariſon of all the Earth? Or what is the whole Earth, in compariſon of the Globe of Heaven, which conſiſts of innumerable Stars, ſome one of which, is far bigger than the ſurface of the whole Earth? Surely, the fiering of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60264:125"/>one City, was but a blaze, to what the burning of the whole Fabrick of Heaven and Earth will be. We have ſeen great things, in reference to this Fire, ſuch as our Fathers never ſaw; but theſe are nothing, to what, both we, and they ſhall ſee at the Great Day. Though I cannot conceive, what kind of fire it ſhould be; that might be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Heavens and melt the Elements; yet will I believe the matter of things contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though I cannot reach the manner, how ſuch things ſhould be. He that can withhold fire from conſuming that which is in it's ſelf Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible, can make thoſe things Combuſtible, which, in their own nature are not ſo, or rather, can inable fire to conſume them. God, by ſetting fire upon the whole World, will let us ſee, He can ſpare it. He is Conſcious to his own power, that he can make another World when he pleaſeth, yea, as many Worlds as now there are Stars. He was infinitely happy before he made the World, (which, in compariſon of Himſelf was but of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, for what is ſix thouſand years to Eternity?) and He will Be ſtill, when the world ſhall be no more. He was Light to himſelf, when, as yet, there were no Sun, Moon, and Stars; yea, he was Light it's ſelf, ſo he is, and ſo he will be, when all thoſe lights ſhall be put out. We cannot better afford, to burn a Ruſh-candle till we have burnt it out, (or, when that is done, miſſe it leſſe) than he can, to burn up the Sun it's ſelf and to disfurniſh all the Stars of their borrowed light.</p>
                     <p>God looks upon this world, as that which is too good for wicked men alwayes to enjoy, but not good enough for his Children alwayes to continue in (<hi>Of whom the world is not worthy,</hi> Heb. 11.)
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60264:125"/>and ſo being not fit, to be the eternal Manſion, either of the one, or of the other, hath reſolved, that when it hath ſerved to the end, for which it was made, it ſhall be burnt: His Friends ſhall have better Manſions, his Enemies ſhall not have ſo good: How ſoon the Conflagration of the World ſhall be, Who can tell? God prefixed the time in which he would deſtroy the firſt World, <hi>viz.</hi> within a hundred and twenty years after warning given, but hath not done ſo by this. <hi>Of that day and hour knows no man; no, not the Son of man</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> as man.) It may be nearer at hand, than we are aware of: The ends of the world ſeem to be upon us: If Saint <hi>John,</hi> and others contemporary with him, called the time wherein they lived, <hi>The l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. What, may this be called? Well might the Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>This their way is their folly,</hi> of them, whoſe inward thought was, that their Houſe and Lands ſhould continue for ever, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49.11. whereas, alas, the world it ſelf ſhall not do ſo. Were they ſecure, that were told, The world ſhould be drowned, at the end of a hundred and twenty years, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; and are not we, that know the world ſhall be burnt, and that, for ought we know, within half that time, or leſs, and yet are not affected with it? Ought not the very thoughts of that burning, to be as a fiery Chariot, to convey our minds from earth to heaven? Ought it not to quench our affections to the world, as one heat puts out another; ſo the heat of the Sun puts out the Fire. I obſerve Saint Peter to ſay, that <hi>The earth and the works that are thereof, ſhall be burnt,</hi> by which, I ſuppoſe, he means the works of Art (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpeaks of none of the works of heaven,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60264:126"/>which are all natural) ſuch as are, ſtrong Towers, ſtately Pallaces, famous Cities, and ſuch like. Now the day in which that ſhall be done (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall come upon the world as a thief in the night,</hi> that is, ſuddenly, and unexpectedly. Nor know I, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe can be made of the doctrine of the Worlds intended Deſtruction by fire, than that which we read, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Seeing then, that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, What manner of perſons ought we to be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs?</hi>

Some are not more hard to believe there is a Hell (a Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is, The ſecond death) than they would have been, to believe, that any ſuch fire, ſhould, or could have fallen upon <hi>London,</hi> as that which lately did. If more dreadful things than we could imagine, do happen unforetold, (as the

For, What is a fire of four days continuance, to that which ſhall laſt more millions of millions of Ages, than there are minutes in the ſpace of four dayes and nights?

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60264:127"/>condemned for their folly and preſumption, when the event proves otherwiſe. We read in Jer. 23.28. <hi>There were prophets of the deceit of their own hearts. VVhich cauſe the people to forget the name of God by the dreams, which they tell every one to his neighbour.</hi> Therefore, ſaith God, <hi>The prophet which hath a dream, let him tell a dream, and he that hath my word let him ſpeak my word ſaithfully VVhat is the chaff to the wheat?</hi> We ſay proverbially, Old Birds cannot be caught with chaff, yet a great many are with ſuch chaff as the prophet ſpeaks of, meaning falſe Predictions: many of which ſhould by right have been written in Hebrew Characters, for that the event ſhews they were to be read backwards, like the preſages of Almanack-makers concerning weather, who frequently tell us, it will be fair when it proves foul, and foul when it proves very fair.</p>
                     <p>The Devil himſelf is more tender of his credit than many men have bin of theirs: for it was always his manner to deliver Oracles in Ambiguous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that, whatſoever the event were, he might not be charged with falſhood; whereas men (that know leſs) have ventur'd to ſpeak as plainly and poſitively as could be, touching things to come, which falling out quite contrary have filled their faces with ſhame. If that had been the worſt, it had been no great matter: but, alas! men have not only wounded their own reputations by their da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring falſe propheſies, but by accuſtoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, to believe and disbelieve again, have greatly propagated Atheiſm in the world, and made the abuſed credulity of many to end in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidelity. They that have been often deceived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come always jealous, and uſe to ſay, Alas! whom
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60264:128"/>or what can we truſt? Though there be no reaſon in the world that men ſhould ſuſpect the Word of God becauſe they have been fruſtrated by the dreams of men; I cannot deny but that there are and have been ſtrong impreſſions from God upon the minds of ſome men concerning future things, but, as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, Haſt thou faith, have it to thy ſelf before God: ſo in this caſe though they themſelves cannot but believe the things which are ſo impreſſed upon them, yet let them keep that faith to themſelves, and not expect others ſhould believe the ſame things, unleſs by miracles they could prove themſelves to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſent of God; or till ſuch time as the event ſhall ſhew they were not miſtaken. A propheſie may indeed and in truth ſignifie much to him that utters it, which yet may ſignifie nothing at all to them that hear it, becauſe he may have received it from God, whereas others have received it but from himſelf. As to all the prophecies concerning great, good things, which ſhould befall <hi>England</hi> in Sixty ſix, be it to themſelves upon what grounds they have had ſuch expectations; ſure I am, nothing hath yet appeared that looks like a fulfilling of them, though the year be almoſt expired. He that foretold that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould die upon ſuch a day, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſending him word the day was come, and he was yet alive, made anſwer that day was come, but it was not paſt &amp; gone, and die he did upon that day; So ſome it may be will tell us that Sixty ſix is come, and far ſpent, but not quite paſt and gone. 'Tis very true, and ſo long as one day or hour of that year laſts, let them lengthen out their hopes. If it produce what they have foretold, I ſhall not envy them the honor of proving true Prophets: but if it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60264:128"/>end as it hath begun, and held on hitherto; give me leave to ſay, that meer humane Predictions touching future Contingencies ought never to be truſted more; and that the fruſtrations of Sixty ſix, ſhould aboliſh or prevent the credulitie of all after-ages.</p>
                     <p>There is a Text or two, which I ſuppoſe, many do build upon, who have great regard to humane propheſies. We read, ſay they, that the <hi>Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi> Pſalm 25.14. But that muſt not be underſtood; as if God did make them that fear him acquainted with all his Secrets: for it is ſaid of Chriſt himſelf, conſidered as man, that <hi>Of that day and hour,</hi> ſpeaking of the day of Judgment, <hi>knows not the ſon of man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Moreover, ſay they, in <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7. it is written, <hi>Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth his ſecrets unto his ſervants the Prophets.</hi> Yea, but where are ſuch Prophets to be found in theſe dayes as were in thoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Approved of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men by miracles, ſigns, and wonders, as is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.22? Doth not Experience ſhew, that the Gift of prophecying (as thereby is meant the infallible predicting of things) is either wholly, or for the moſt part at an end, as well as ſeveral other Gifts, which were intended but for the infancy of the Church: If it be ſaid, that it is written, <hi>In the laſt dayes, your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams, your ſons and daughters ſhall propheſie,</hi> it is evident, from <hi>Acts</hi> 3.16. that that was fulfilled in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time: for, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> when the Holy Ghoſt was poured out upon the Diſciples, when they were filled with the Holy Ghoſt and ſpake with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongues, <hi>This is that which was ſpoken by</hi> Joel, <hi>I
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60264:129"/>will poure out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and they ſhall propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. But, it is further ſaid, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of ſome good men, have come to paſſe, they have hit right (as they call it). That may be too, and yet ſuch as they may be no Prophets to us, that is, no ſuch Prophets as we are bound to believe, till the Event have declared, that they themſelves were not deceived.: It may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes from Divine Revelation, that men propheſie rightly concerning things to come: A man may draw a Bow at an adventure, and ſhoot at random, and yet happen to hit the mark, though he that ſhall do ſo, will miſſe it much oftner. Now, as one ſaith, <hi>Men mind when predictions hit, not when they miſſe,</hi> and that is the reaſon, they give ſo much heed to them: Whereas indeed, as in predicting of weather, when it ſhall be fair, and when it ſhall be fowl; ſo in other things, though menſpeak but what comes next it is almoſt as hard to be alwayes out, as it is to be alwayes right.</p>
                     <p>How fain would I prevail with men not to lean upon the broken Reed of uncertain Prophecies? <hi>Whereon, if a man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce him</hi> (as was ſaid of <hi>Egypt</hi>) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36.6. Pierce you they will, more wayes than one; as namely, With ſhame, when you ſee your conſidence diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: With forrow, when you ſee your hopes fruſtrated: With reproach, when others ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride you, and ſay, Is this the good time you lookt for? Is this the Deliverance you expected? What now is become of all your Prophecies, touching what would be ſuch and ſuch a year? All this Reproach you might ſave, if you would believe no more than what the Scripture warrants you to believe:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60264:129"/>Where doth that ſpeak of the glorious things that ſhall be in the year 1666? or, give you to expect more from that, than from any other year? Are not Divine-Promiſes ſufficient for your comfort, unleſs you eake them out with human Prophecies, (as the Papiſts do the Counſels of Scripture, with the Traditions of men:) It is well, if ſome do not derive more comfort from fallible Predictions, than from the infallible Word. Is not <hi>the Name of the Lord a ſtrong Tower?</hi> Why then will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your ſelves to a <hi>refuge of lies?</hi> It is enough for poor deluded <hi>Jews</hi> to be alwayes comforting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with one vain Prophecy or other, (as they are obſerved to be ſeldom without:) but, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſo to do, who have a ſure Word of Prophecy; which they ſhould take heed to, <hi>as to a light ſhining in a dark place.</hi> Be conſident, Faith, and Credulity are very different things: The firſt builds upon a Rock; the laſt upon Quick-ſands. Believe, but be not Credulous; many credulous people make many falſe Prophets, (as they ſay Receivers make Thieves:) There will never want people to make Propheſies, ſo long as there are enough to entertain them, and to truſt upon them. Jer. 5.31. <hi>The Prophets propheſie falſely, and the People love to have it ſo.</hi> There are too many, that ſay in their hearts, <hi>Si populus vult decipi decipietur:</hi> If People will be deceived, they ſhall. Many ſmall Prophets, in this, and other ages, ſeem Merchant-adventurers for a little credit; They will be the Authors of a Prediction right or wrong; it is fit it be pleaſing, whether it be true or no: If it come to paſs, they ſhall have a great deal of credit by it; and, in the mean time, it makes them to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more taken notice of; and, if it be fruſtrated,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60264:130"/>they are not the firſt that were miſtaken, there have been, and are many falſe Prophets beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: When ſhall I ſee men ſo modeſt, as to tell their uncertain Predictions, as their Dreams, not as heavenly Dictates; in their own names, and not in the Name of God, ſaying, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord:</hi> but rather, My mind bodes me ſo and ſo; Thus ſaith my imagination, and I cannot withſtand it. At leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when ſhall I ſee others ſo wiſe as to hearken to them, only as ſuch, and upon no other account till experience have proved them to be more than to. It is time enough to believe a humane Propheſie when you ſee it fulfilled; and you pay it a ſufficient reſpect, if, in the mean time, you ſuſpend your judgment, and forbear to cenſure it. O <hi>Sixty-ſix!</hi> Thou center of human Propheſies! Thou Ocean, into which all the Rivers of Conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural Predictions did run! If I live to ſee thee end, as thou haſt continued hitherto; for thy ſake, if for nothing elſe (yet, upon other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too,) if men will find confidence to make a thouſand Prophecies, no wayes countenanced by Scripture, I ſhall not find Faith to believe one of them.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60264:131"/>which God began to Create the World, in the firſt Day of the Week did he begin to deſtroy that great City: Yea, The Day of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, was the firſt Day of <hi>London</hi>'s Death and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. Did not good Men hope to have been Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hearing, Singing of <hi>Pſalms;</hi> Eating and Drinking, in remembrance of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> on that very day, in which they were forced to be quenching of Houſes, carrying out of Goods, conveying away their Wives and Children? How ſadly were Churches filled on that Day, not with Men and Women, (as upon other ſuch Dayes,) but with Wares and Houſhold-ſtuff? And, How much more ſadly were they emptied, ſome of them, on that very Day; not by exportation, but by conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

                     <p>O fatal, and never to be forgotten Sabbath! No emblem, as other of thoſe dayes, of that reſt, which glorious Saints injoy in Heaven; but rather of the day of Judgment, which is called, <hi>The great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day of the Lord: Black-Sunday,</hi> ſome will call it; (as formerly there was much diſcourſe of a <hi>Black-Monday:</hi>) That was expected, and came not this was not expected, and yet it came, <hi>like a thief in the night.</hi> I doubt not but men went to their beds over-night as ſecurely as ever they had done in their lives: yea, thoſe that dwelt in the houſe where it firſt began, and ſlept as ſoundly, for the time, as ever they uſed to do, not queſtioning but the inſuing-Sabbath would be like all the reſt; but when the early morning began to fall-in-travel

                     <p>But, Will it vield us nothing of a profitable <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> that this fire began in a <hi>Bakers</hi>-Houſe? Had the hazardouſneſs of that Calling, as to matter of fire, or careleſneſs of the People, been the cauſe of its beginning there; when the Natural cauſe had been ſo plain, the Moral ground of it had been leſs worth our inquiring: But, I find not any
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60264:132"/>thing of that nature ſo much as ſuſpected; yea, ſome to this day will not believe, that it came to paſs otherwiſe, then by an immediate hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Whoſe Incredulouſneſs in one thing is not ſo great, but their Credulity in another is greater, if they think it were fired from Heaven immediately. That it came by any in the Family is not miſtruſted; that it was by His meanes that Confeſſed himſelf Guilty, or by the Treachery of any other, they will not believe: And, if neither of theſe two wayes, there is but a third can be thought of, (and they muſt have a Faith of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that believe it to have come that way;) and, that is, As Fire came upon <hi>Sodom, viz.</hi> from heaven immediately: But, when I conſider where it began, (not to diſpute how, or by whoſe means,) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well over-look a paſſage or two in the Prophet <hi>Hoſeah; viz.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60264:133"/>and, by that time the Oven is hot enough, and the Bread leavened enough, he will be ſure to wake, and fall to his Buſineſs: Moreover, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8.

If we have been as a <hi>Cake but half-bak't,</hi> if <hi>burning like a fiery-Oven</hi> with the heat of luſt, and in the mean time ſleeping in ſecurity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How juſt was it with God to ſend ſuch a Fire as this upon us?

Though <hi>Bakers</hi> can ſleep quietly when they have put fire in the Oven; yet, if they know there be fire on the Houſ-top, they can take no reſt; Advertiſe them of that, and they will ſtart up preſently, and indeavour to quench it. I thought fit to touch upon both theſe Circumſtances, not as pretending to know the end of God in either of them; (though he, who acteth all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Counſel of his Will, hath a wiſe end; not onely in all his actings, but in all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of them;) but rather to ſhow, that <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </head>
                     <p>PIty, is an affection that ſhould ſcarcely be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from any that are in great diſtreſs and miſery; but yet is much more due to ſome, then to others. Where no miſery is, there is no room for pity, and where there is nothing but miſery to beſpeak it (as in reference to that Prodigal, who by riotous courſes brought himſelf to husks) there is no cauſe for much. But where merit and miſery go hand in hand, the greateſt yearnings of our moſt tender bowels are called for. God will not take it ill that we pity thoſe whom he thinks fit to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; becauſe one of his great ends in puniſhing ſome, is that he might excite pity and compaſſion in others towards them: I have read that Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> not long before his Execution was deſired to cut his locks, for no other end, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, than leſt his Venerable hoary Fleece ſhould ſtir up too much compaſſion in thoſe that were to be ſpectators at his death. But ſo far is the great God from that, that he had rather we ſhould number the grey heirs of miſery which are upon the heads of men, in order to our pitying of them. To tell, Why the late Inhabitants of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> are objects of Royal pity, or to move to it, were to diſcourſe, why children under great ſufferings ſhould be compaſsionated by their Parents (For
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60264:134"/>Kings are Fathers, and Subjects their Sons and Daughters). Whereas the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Can a mother forget her child, that ſhe ſhould not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the child of her womb?</hi> and though it adds, <hi>yea, ſhe may,</hi> yet it inſinuates that they ſeldom do or can. What reaſon Courtiers have to pity Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, were eaſie to alledge; For, Have not Citizens, ſometimes had ſo much pity for them, as that they ſeemed to have none for themſelves? Why ſhould not Citizens be a little in Courtiers books, if ſome Courtiers have been and are, a great deal in theirs? It is but ingenuity to afford them pity who have given them credit. As for thoſe that lead a Countrey life they know full well that Citizens had wont to be their beſt Chapmen, and to give them a good price for thoſe commodities, and proviſions which they thought too good for themſelves, and withall to furniſh them with the beſt things which they ſtood in need of.</p>
                     <p>Had <hi>Londoners</hi> been the worſt of people the depth of their preſent miſery, compared with the height of their former proſperity had challenged pity and compaſſion from their very enemies: but if it may be made appear that they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as Civil as Religious, as Charitable, and in many other reſpects as commendable as moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world, none but ill natur'd perſons can refrain commiſerating them, much more rejoyce and triumph in their ſufferings. The worſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they have in the world muſt needs confeſs that no people were generally more Civil and Moral then they. As for Religion, I know there are ſeveral ſtandards by which men meaſure, and judge of that (though indeed, and in truth there is but One, whereby to judge of it, to wit, the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60264:134"/>Word of God) but if conformity to the duties both of the firſt and ſecond Table, if love to God and to our neighbours (ſo far as men can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern) may denominate perſons Religious (as ſurely it is that muſt do it) pure Religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled did as much abound in <hi>London,</hi> as in any place whatſoever. I meddle not with charity in point of judging (Cenſuring is every where too common) but as for Charity in giving and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring to thoſe that are in want, both of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and of another, if that be a virtue (as doubtleſs it is) <hi>London</hi> hath been as eminent for it in all times in which ſeveral parties have taken their turns in ſuffering as any place I know. In the ſpace of twenty years and upwards that <hi>England</hi> hath been diſſetl'd by War, it may be thouſands that by the unhappines of the times have been brought to ſtraits and exigences, they and theirs had periſhed, but for the charity of <hi>London,</hi> more than of all other places, whilſt ſome have taken care of the Diſciples of <hi>Paul,</hi> others of <hi>Apollos,</hi> others of <hi>Cephas,</hi> others of <hi>Chriſt</hi> without reſpect to any of thoſe diſtinctions (which beſt became good Chriſtians); and ſo all have been taken care of, more or leſs, by thoſe poor Citizens who are now many of them themſelves become the objects of Charity. <hi>London</hi> will not want for pity, if it be pitied by no more then all, and only thoſe, that firſt and laſt have been pitied and relieved by it, and that now and hereafter will dearly miſs it.</p>
                     <p>I would not it ſhould grate upon the minds of honeſt Citizens, undone by the fire, to think or ſuſpect that a great many have no pity for them: All good people have, and they that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, have no pity, ſo much as for their own ſouls.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60264:135"/>I obſerve they uſe to have moſt pity from God, who have leaſt from men, being withall ſuch as deſerve it. When <hi>Penninah</hi> did ſorely vex <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> to make her fret, becauſe God had ſhut up her womb, <hi>Hannah</hi> throve the better for it; for God lookt upon her affliction, and opened her womb, when her Rival had ſhut up her bowels towards her, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.5. When <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed <hi>David</hi> being at that time under trouble from <hi>Abſalom, David ſaid, It may be the Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite me good for his curſing this day,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.13. Such as triumph in your miſeries may do you a greater kindneſs then they are aware of, according to that in Prov. 24.18. <hi>Rejoyce not when thine enemy falleth, leſt the Lord ſee it, and turn away his wrath from him.</hi> They that will not look upon you as the objects of their pity, are indeed the objects of yours; For ſo are all they that ſhew themſelves to be neither Chriſtians nor Men: and it is a good preſage, you ſhall not always want pity for that you cannot have it from a great many people whilſt you want it. Pity is that virtue which <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> are famous for, and therefore every <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that is void of it, wants the common virtue and character of his Countrey; and he that hath none to beſtow upon this occaſion, ſeems to have none at all. I know not that man that would not be loath the world ſhould think that he had no commiſeration for the preſent caſe of <hi>London;</hi> and why is it, but, becauſe it would thence follow, that he were of a marvellous ill nature, and unworthy of any pity to be ſhewed to himſelf, even in the greateſt extremity that could befall him. One ſaith, the reaſon why, they that have children are uſually more affectionate, than thoſe that have
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60264:135"/>none, is, becauſe their bowels are often called upon. By that reaſon they that have no pity, now when that Affection in men is ſo much called upon are never like to have any. But a pity like that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which S. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

If a brother be naked and deſtitute of daily food, and one ſay unto him, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he gives him nothing, &amp;c. I ſay a pity like that charity, which yet is more then ſome men have, is little worth. But would men ſhew themſelves truly compaſſionate, toward that deſolated City, and the late miſerable Inhabitants of it, if they have intereſt in heaven, let them pray for the reflouriſhing both of it, &amp; them; if they have intereſt on earth, let them promote it; if they have parts let them adviſe and contrive how it may be effected; if they have Purſes, let them contribute towards it; if they have all of theſe, let them further it all, and every of theſe ways. Call your ſelves Papiſts, Frenchmen, Hectors, any thing, but true Engliſhmen, true Chriſtians, true Proteſtants, if you have no pity for the deſolations of <hi>London.</hi> I doubt not but there are ſome Turks and Jews that have, or would have had, if they had known <hi>London</hi> in it's proſperity, and ſhould now ſee it in it's aſhes. O Lord, If men will not pity the miſeries of <hi>London,</hi> the matter is not great; poſſibly if they did, it might not ſignifie much: onely let Thy bowels yearn towards, and thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings be kindled within thee, and Thou (who haſt ſpoken concerning it, to pluck up, and pull down) ſpeak in thy due time, to build, and to plant it.</p>

                     <head>MEDITATION XXV. Upon thoſe that have loſt all by the Fire.</head>
                     <p>VVHat ſhall we ſay to them that have loſt all? who tell us, that before the fire, they were worth ſo many hundreds, or, ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, but ſince then, they are worth nothing, yea, worſe than nothing. Surely they ought not to mourn as men without hope. If they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as rich as <hi>Job</hi> was at firſt, they cannot be poorer now than he was afterwards. Hatred in God towards men, cannot be known by ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents as thoſe; for <hi>Job,</hi> who was in like caſe, was a Perſon greatly beloved of God. Do they fear that they and theirs ſhall periſh? Not ſo neither, for rather than the Iſraelites ſhould periſh in the Wilderneſs, God gave them bread from Heaven, and waters out of the Rock. Ravens ſhall feed them, if they be ſuch as put their truſt in God, rather than they ſhall famiſh. Some, have no Children; they, it is to be ſuppoſed, may make a good ſhift: others, have bad Children, and what ſhould they do with Eſtates to ſpend upon their luſts? Others, have good Children, and let not them doubt but God will provide for them. Hath the onely wiſe God no wayes whereby to make up your loſſes? Did he not give to <hi>Job,</hi> double for all that which he had taken away from him? and can he not do ſo by you?</p>
                     <p>Is it your great trouble, that you have loſt all at once? I have heard of one, who having a great number of coſtly Glaſſes, did himſelf break them all at one time, that he might not be diſquieted
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60264:136"/>time after time, by the accidental breaking of them one by one. Had your Eſtates been taken from you by piece-meals, now a part, and then a part, till all had been conſumed, that might have proved more grievous to you; and ſo it hath fared with many men. Will you ſay, All is loſt, becauſe your Eſtates are gone? Know, he that is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed, cannot loſe his All, yea, the beſt part of what he hath, cannot be loſt, as is ſaid of <hi>Mary,</hi> that <hi>ſhe had choſen that good part, which could not be taken from her.</hi> I have heard of a good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, when her Children died, had wont to comfort herſelf with this, to wit, that The Lord liveth; who, being more than ordinarily dejected for the death of one of her Children, that ſhe had a more particular affection for; a Child that had obſerved what ſhe had wont to ſay, and how full of heavineſs ſhe then was, came to her and ſaid, Mother, Is the Lord dead? How may the words of that Child, upbraid the carriage of thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who mourn over their loſſes, as if they had not an Everliving God to rejoyce in? Is it ſtrange to you to be poor, who have heretofore always enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed riches and plenty? know, that it is one point of a Chriſtians Excellency and heavenly Skill, to be able to act ſeveral and different parts well, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have learned how to abound, and how to want, how to be full, and how to be empty; how, in every Eſtate therewithall to be content.</hi> They are unfound bodies, that can onely bear the Summer, but not alſo the Winter, Spring and Autumne. You ſay, you have nothing now, How many are there, that never had any thing, to ſpeak of? Is it no mercy or priviledge, to have enjoyed good things for a long time paſt, though we may not enjoy them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes?
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60264:137"/>If men have had good ſight, good hearing, good health, till they come to be old, and then all of theſe begin to decay, or be quite loſt, do they, or ought they, to reckon it no mercy that they have enjoyed theſe things ſo long? If you ſay, you cannot live upon nothing (that is, nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) how many hundreds, yea, thouſands, are, thorough the goodneſs of God, provided for from year to year, who have no certainty to live upon? Now you have loſt the things you had, poſſibly you will thereby be excited, to look after the things which can never be loſt, which otherwiſe, it may be, you had never done. Hath the ſire conſumed your money, or money-worth, as if it had all been but ſo much droſs, this, peradventure, may make you look after that gold, tried in the fire, which no ſire can conſume, and then, your unſpeakable loſs will prove inconceivable gain. What great difference, between the worlds leaving us, and our leaving it? You muſt ſhortly have left it, if it had not firſt left you.</p>
                     <p>Truſt God, and doubt not but he will bear your charges thorough the world, and more of this world you need not care for. What a noiſe will this make in the world, that you have loſt all, and who, that hath any thing to ſpare, if they know your caſe, will not contribute to your relief? You have yet the Love of relations and friends, the Charity of men, the Fruit of your own inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and induſtry, the Bounty of heaven, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of Divine Promiſes, all theſe things you have, beſides ſeveral others, to help and ſuccour you; therefore, ſay not, You are undone, though all be loſt for the preſent. How many have, from a fair Eſtate, been brought to a morſel of Bread,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60264:137"/>not by Caſualty, but by Crimes, ſuch as God might have left you to, as by that <hi>fire</hi> which, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>will conſume to deſtruction, and root out all a mans increaſe, Job</hi> 31.12. Now conſider, how much better your condition is than theirs. Are you as thoſe that have nothing, think of the Apoſtles words, <hi>a Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> If, either you are true Believers, or ſhall hereafter be ſuch, thoſe words of the ſame Apoſtle will be verified in you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. <hi>All things are yours, ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>

                     <p>VVHat a mercy is it, that you have loſt but half, when ſo many others have loſt all? How much better is half a Loaf, as our Proverb ſpeaks, than no Bread? As <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth, Thou and Zibah divide;</hi> ſo hath God deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the caſe, betwixt the fire and you. You are, at moſt, but like <hi>David</hi>'s Servants, the one half of whoſe Beards were ſhaven by <hi>Hanan,</hi> and their Garments cut in the middle. How much better is it, to have one Arm, than none; to have but one Eye, than to be ſtark blind? The man that was wounded, and left but half dead, recovered again, by the help and favour of the good Samaritan; and ſo may you. Poſſibly, that half or part which is left you, is more than many mens All: Your Gleanings better than the Vintage of many others. The Ancients ran much upon ſuch a ſaying as this, <hi>Dimidium plus toto,</hi> that <hi>half was better then the whole,</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:60264:138"/>meaning, the former with quietneſs and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was much better then the latter without it. God can give you twice ſo much contentment with half ſo much Eſtate. If you ſay, and ſay truly, that you had ſcarce enough before, and now have but half ſo much as you had then; there are that have more by half then they needed, and how knoweſt thou but God may incline them to conſider thee who haſt ſcarce half enough?</p>
                     <p>But, Oh! the miſerable world in which many whoſe cup overflows will let others have nothing of theirs, if they have but ſomething of their own, though that ſomething be next to nothing. If men that have ten children have but enough to maintain one, are they no objects of pity and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? If a man have doublet and breeches ſuch as may ſerve his turn, but neither hat to his head, nor ſhoos to his feet, will you not commiſerate him? Did the good <hi>Samaritane</hi> overlook the man he met becauſe he was but half dead? did he ſtay till he were ready to give up the ghoſt before he would do any thing for him? This is the manner of but too many men: but the comfort is, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father he knows whereof you ſtand in need. Whether the moiety of what thou ſometimes hadſt be, or be not enough for thy occaſions, Bleſs God for it.

I cannot call you brands ſnatcht out of the fire, for you were better than ſo; brands are partly burnt, ſo were not you. Fall down and adore that diſtinguiſhing-mercy, which hath ſo preſerved you, and made a hedge about you. Alas! if all had been great loſers, how ſhould one have been able to help another, whereas now ſome are able to ſuccor others, if they be but as willing. God is trying you what good Stewards you will be of thoſe Talents, which he hath continued to you full and whole, whileſt others are either totally deprived of theirs, or at leaſtwiſe much diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He expects you ſhould make yourſelves poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (for the preſent) by your Charity, though he hath not made you ſo by the Fire; and woe be to you, if you do it not. He could have forced all your Eſtates from you, as he did from others; but, he thought fit to prove you, as to what you would part with freely.

It might have been your lot to have ſtood in need of receiving; and, now you are left able to give (which is a more bleſſed thing) will you not do it? All that was ſaved from the fire was given you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and will you not lend God a part, who hath given you the whole? and what is that lending to God, but giving to the Poor?

                     </head>
                     <p>VVE ſay, It is an evil wind, that blows no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy any good. Some were honeſt gainers, (and much good may it do them); others diſhoneſt. Some could not let their Tenements before the fire, who have ſince, let them for moderate Rents; ſuch are honeſt gainers: Others have let their houſes at moſt exceſſive Rates and ſuch have loaded themſelves with diſhoneſt gain. But be their gains one way or another, I think no man ought, for the preſent, to pocket the money which he hath clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten by the fire, (if it be ſo they can ſpare it). <hi>David</hi> would not drink of the waters of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> which were brought to him, becauſe, as he ſaid, They were the price of Blood, meaning, his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had ventured their lives for it: What men have gotten by this fire, is little leſſe than the price of Blood, conſidering how many were impoveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that a few might be inriched, or rather, that the inriching of but a very few, is by the undoing of many thouſands.</p>
                     <p>Men may look upon their gains by this fire, as <hi>Deodates:</hi> Let as many as are able be their own Almoners, and give it back to God. Is it not a Sabbatical year (in a doleful ſenſe) for that the poor City now injoyeth it's Sabbath? and in a Sabbatical year that did bear a better interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the rich were not ſuffered to reap, but were to leave the Crop to the poor, as appeareth, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.11. with <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.5. If men who have only ſaved what they had before, ought
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60264:140"/>to contribute to them that have loſt; how much more ought they, who have received an Addition by this very means? To Build upon the Ruines of others, is one of the worſt Foundations that can be. Let it never be ſaid, The fire hath made you rich, whilſt ſuch multitudes continue poor, miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably poor, whom meerly the fire hath made ſo. We uſe to ſay, Men have gotten thoſe things out of the fire, which they came hardly by. But what men got by, or out of, the late fire, was eaſily come by; well may it go leightly, for it leightly came, yet neither doth that go leightly, which goes to the uſe of Charity. When I conſider, how this fire which hath ruined many, hath raiſed ſome, it brings to mind what is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.52. <hi>He hath put down the mighty from their ſeats, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath ſent empty away.</hi> How ſtrangely, and by ſeeming contraries, doth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God bring things to paſs, that when a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall fire hapned, ſome men ſhould be made by it! So a Priſon made way for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s preferment; and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his running away from his Maſter, for his returning to God and to himſelf, and a better Servant to his Maſter than ever. And Eſtate caſt upon men by the deſolating Fire, ſounds like ſuch a Riddle as that of <hi>Sampſon, Out of the eater came meat, and out the ſtrong came ſweetneſs:</hi> Is it not as a Honey-comb found in the Carcaſe of a Lion? You whom God by this fire hath unexpectedly enabled more than ever, to eat the Fat and drink the Sweet (you know what I allude to) ſee that you ſend portion; to them for whom nothing is provided.</p>

It periſhed by fire, and muſt be ſaved by water; for, that, if any thing, will make it once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain what it was before, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of a Tree, onely the Root whereof is left in the ground, that thorough the ſcent of water, it will ſprout again. How venerable is <hi>London,</hi> were it but for its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, of which <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> reports, that it was called an ancient City in his time, which was above twelve hundreds years ago; and <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Tacitus</hi> ſeems to do the like, three hundred years before him, telling us, that, for multitudes of Merchants and Commerce, <hi>London</hi> was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, fifteen hundred years ago: nor can we ſuppoſe it to have preſently arrived at that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Who would not aſſiſt the building of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City in that place, hoping it may continue as many Ages as the other did, and longer too, if God be pleaſed to prevent the like diſaſter. I confeſs, I love not to hear men boaſt at ſuch a time as this what they will do, or what ſhall be done, as to the building of <hi>London</hi> more glorious than ever. The Inhabitants of <hi>Samaria</hi> are blamed for ſaying, <hi>The Bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewen Stones; the Sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into Cedars.</hi> We are but putting on our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to re-building; let us not boaſt, as if we were putting of it off: This is not a time in which to ſay much, though it becomes us to do all we can. If we may ſee but ſuch another City it will be a great mercy, but one more glorious than that we may ſcarce expect till we ſee it. Alas! how many difficulties is that work clogg'd with? How ſcarce and dear are all materials? How poor are many that deſire to build? How hard, and almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible will it be, to ſatisfie the Intereſt of all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60264:141"/>proprietors? Amongſt all the Models that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented for that purpoſe, How hard will it be to know how to pitch upon that which may be moſt convenient? If we build every where, as before, it will be incommodious for Paſſage, dangerous for Fire; if by a new Platform, it is hard not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juxious to multitudes of People, whoſe Houſes ſtood inconveniently, as to the Publick: Lord, Give our Senators double and treble wiſdom, that they may be ſatisfactory-Repairers of ſo great breaches.</p>
                     <p>But, How ſhall Moneys be Levied for the re-building of <hi>London,</hi> where the Eſtates of perſons concerned do fall ſhort? Two Expedients for that I have propounded already; One was, by the Mercy and Charity of thoſe perſons who have loſt little or nothing by the fire; and, who have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they could well ſpare: The other is, By the Juſtice and due Repentance of all thoſe perſons, Carters, Landlords, and others, who have raiſed uncoſcionable gains to themſelves, by means of the late Fire; whoſe duty it is, to reſtore, not only the principal of what they have unlawfully got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the fire, but ſome certain over-plus, as was provided under the Law, in caſes of <hi>Reſtitution:</hi> When that is done, I wiſh there were a certain Pole-fine, or Mulct, ſet upon the head of every common ſin, not made capital; which additional-Pole, levied upon all perſons that are able, when once convicted of Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, Curſing, yea Lying its ſelf, might be for, and towards the re-building of <hi>London:</hi> I ſpeak of an Additional pecuniary Puniſhment for thoſe Crimes, both for that the former and preſent Mulcts have not been ſufficient to reſtrain Men; as alſo, for that great ſumms are ſtill in arrear to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60264:142"/>Juſtice; becauſe thoſe kind of Penalties have been but ſeldom inflicted, poſſibly not one time in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that they ought to have been. To do this, were not to build <hi>London</hi> upon the ſins of the People, (as ſome will object;) but upon the puniſhment of Sin, and due execution of Juſtice, which would be a glorious foundation. If but one ſhilling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary were levied upon men <hi>toties quoties;</hi> that is, ſo often as they are, or might be, convicted for any of the fore-mentioned ſins: How noble a City might thoſe Fines build, if men ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo bad as now they are? Whilſt ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, (and thoſe able enough to pay for it) ſtick not to ſwear hundreds of Oaths in one day, beſides all the Execrations and Lies they become guilty of in one day. But, if men had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves, than by their Crimes help to re-build the City, the former ſhall be as welcom as the latter; and, the latter may, in one ſenſe, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the former. But, if that way of raiſing Money be ſo happily prevented, poſſibly ſo ſoon as God ſhall pleaſe to turn our <hi>Swords into Plow-ſhares, and</hi> our <hi>Spears into Pruning-hooks:</hi> The Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Governors may think fit to make ſome coercive-levy, for once, towards the relieving of friends, as they have formerly done; for, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the humbling of Forraign-Enemies: and, as the Ruin of <hi>London</hi> is a National-Calamity, ſo, Who knows whether our Rulers may not pleaſe to make the re-building of it ſomewhat of a National-Charge? as it would certainly be an honour, and an advantage to the whole Nation: But, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring what is ſaid, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 127.1. <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe,</hi> (and ſo the City,) <hi>they labour in vain that build it;</hi> I cannot but further conſider
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60264:142"/>what words we ſhould take unto our ſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to plead with God, that <hi>London,</hi> (if it ſo ſeem good to him,) may be built again: And, May we not plead thus? O Lord, How many hundred Families are there, whoſe livelihoods ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the re-building of that City? What hard ſhift do they make in the mean-time, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling many of them like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in Tents or Bothes?

And, Haſt thou not ſaid, <hi>That with the Merciful thou wilt ſhow thy ſelf Merciful?</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there, whoſe bowels yearn, and whoſe hearts bleed over the deſolations of <hi>London?</hi> Shall Men pity them, and will not God much more, who is of infinite compaſſions? What ſtrong affections have theſe poor hearts for the place where that City ſometimes ſtood? How do they cleave, as it were, to the Ruins of it? How loth are they to remove at any diſtance from it, as if they could ſettle to no buſineſs any where elſe, no more than <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Kine, which, as they ſay, cannot give down their Milk, unleſs their Calves, or ſomething in their likeneſs ſtand by their ſides: How do their Enemies, yea, and thine alſo, inſult and triumph, whilſt poor <hi>London</hi> lieth in aſhes; ſaying, <hi>Aha, Aha,</hi> ſo would we have it? Shall <hi>London</hi> be alwayes a Ruinous Heap, whilſt <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> continue flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Cities? Haſt thou not a greater <hi>Controverſie</hi> with them than with it? Doſt thou ſuffer them to ſtand?

Shall <hi>England</hi> never be like its ſelf again? or, How can it be ſo, if <hi>London</hi> be no more? Was ever the REſtauration of a City more prayed for, and ſhall all thoſe Prayers fall to the ground? Lord,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60264:143"/>What joy will there be, when the re-building of <hi>London</hi> ſhall be once finiſhed? How will the top-Stone be laid with Acclamations of Grace, Grace, Pſal. 71.20. <hi>Thou, who haſt ſhowed that place and People great and ſore troubles, vouchſafe to quicken them again, and bring them up again from the depths of the Earth: Increaſe their greatneſs, and comfort them on every ſide.</hi>

                     <p>Oh the hurtfulneſs even of coſtly Mixtures in ſome caſes, Water alone had done well; but, Wine and Oyl added to it did a world of miſchief: So in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> Water alone doth as well as can be, (ſuiting the Inſtitution;) but, to add Cream, and Spittle, is both ſinful, ſlovenly, and ridiculous: But, O naſty beaſts! Why do you uſe Spittle above all the reſt? VVould you imitate that Miracle whereby the <hi>eyes of the blind-man were opened with Spittle</hi> for one thing? Why then do you not uſe Clay too?

Though ſometimes we are the worſe for it, yet it would be worſe for us to be always without it.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60264:145"/>to blow up their houſes, leſt they and many more ſhould periſh together. Did we ever think that a time would come, when men would beg, and intreat that not only their neighbours houſes might be blown up, but their own alſo, and count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beholden to them that would do it? God's ways in Judgements, as well as Mercies, are above ours, as far as the heavens are above the earth. I cannot but think, what a name that way of Blowing-up-houſes hath gotten; how much it is applauded and how much men lament that it was either not conſidered or not permitted ſooner. We are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to men that do us good, though by harſheſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and why ſhould we not be ſo to God, when he is pleaſed to teach us obedience to himſelf, though it be by briars and thorns (as <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the men of <hi>Succoth);</hi> when he prevents or abates our pride, though it be by ſending a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Sathan to buffet us. But how quickly was a great and ſtately Houſe, firſt blown up, and then laid flat upon the ground? It was but as it were a flaſh of lightning, then a clap of thunder, then one jumpt upwards (as if it had been that it might take the greater Fall); then a great ſmoak, and preſently all was in the duſt. Scarce could a ſtrong hand have ſooner ſhuck in pieces the rotten branches of an old worm-eaten tree; yea, ſcarcely could it have made the over-ripe fruit of a tender plant (as it might be the Vine) to fall ſooner to the ground then many goodly Fabricks by the irreſiſtible force of Gun-powder were ſhaken to pieces, and preſently laid in the duſt.</p>
                     <p>How eaſie is the diſſolution of any earthly thing? The way of making things is as it were up-hill; men puff and blow at it, and are out of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60264:146"/>breath, and muſt take time. But deſtruction is a precipice. Things no ſooner begin to tumble from the top, but they are preſently at the bottom of that hill. Gun-powder it's ſelf is the moſt eaſily ruined, and deſtroyed of any thing; Thouſands of Batrels if they lie together may be blown up by means of one ſpark, and yet no earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo able to deſtroy as is Gun-powder; ſo that it ſhould ſeem nothing, is more Paſſive, and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more active then that. So have I obſerved amongſt men that none are ſo apt to ruine others as thoſe that are moſt apt to ruine or be ruined themſelves. As deſtructive a thing as Gun-powder is, did we not owe the preſervation of what was preſerved to that under God, and to them that had the courage to uſe it, more then to any thing elſe. Sometimes there is no way to ſave the moſt but by deſtroying a part; ſo that high Prieſt propheſied, that it was of neceſſity that one ſhould die for the people; though other-whiles if you deſtroy any, you can ſave none, as <hi>Paul</hi> told them that were with him, Except theſe abide in the ſhip you cannot be ſaved. Men skilful to deſtroy, if they knew when to uſe their faculty, and when to forhear it, might be very ſerviceable; foraſmuch, as deſtruction in part, is ſometimes the only way to deliverance; as there is no way to ſave the life of a man that hath a Gangered-Limb, unleſs you cut it off.</p>
                     <p>But, Why was this way of blowing up Houſes no ſooner thought of, (being ſo effectual as it is)? nothing could be more obvious; but God is wont to blind thoſe whom he intends to ruine. <hi>Quos Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter perdere vult, dement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>HOw good is it to take things in time, to meet a Diſeaſe, as the <hi>Poet</hi> phraſeth it; <hi>Venienti oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere morbo:</hi> How many complain, at firſt, of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Cold; that cold turns to a Feaver; that feaver from Benigne to Malignant; and, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity ends in Death. Sometimes the ſcratch of a Pin, not ſeaſonably lookt after, Feſters and Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes, and doth coſt men their Lives. Moſt Men think, that, if ſo effectual means, as were uſed at Iaſt, had been known at firſt, at leaſt-wiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; or rather, if not only known and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, but alſo reſolved upon, and proſecuted; that Fire, which, at laſt, carried all before it, had been ſtiſled, as it were, in its Cradle. But alaſs! for poor Man-kind, it is generally one aggravation of their miſeries, that ſome way was made for their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and they were not ſenſible of it till it was too late: Not incountring a danger at the firſt, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſprings from deſpiſing of it; which to do, is a very evil and an impolitick thing: For uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the greateſt things have but ſmall beginnings; and that Cloud, which at firſt is no bigger than a <hi>hand-breadth,</hi> may ſpread, till it cover all the face of heaven. <hi>How great a flame doth a little fire kindle,</hi> as the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> ſpeaks by St. <hi>James.</hi> It is ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, that things will conſtantly ſucceed ſo well
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60264:147"/>as generally they do; Fires have ordinarily been quenched without blowing up of Houſes, but it would not be ſo in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is good to ſuſpect, and provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the worſt, as careful Women do for a Quinſey, and give a remedy againſt it, when their Children have but a fore-throat; though many ſore-throats never end in a Quinſey. <hi>Abundans cautela non weet:</hi> If we prepare for the worſt, and it prove otherwiſe, the beſt will help it ſelf. I ſhall live in hope, that after ſo great a Warning given, none will hereafter be <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> or offer to play an after-Game; but will apply themſelves to the remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Evils at their firſt coming. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning Anger, ſaith, <hi>The beginning of ſtrife i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>MEDITATION XXXII. Upon the City-Miniſters, whoſe Churches were ſaved from the Fire.</head>
                     <p>GIve a reaſon, if you can, Why your Churches were not burnt, as well as were the moſt of your Brethrens? Why was an Ark provided for you, (whoſe number was ſcarce twice eight,) when all the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> beſides were (as ſuch) ſwept away by that Deluge of Fire, (if I may ſo call it,) which did then overflow? Were you the only <hi>Noahs</hi> that were in the Old World? VVere there no Preachers of Righteouſneſs but your ſelves? or, Did you help to build that Ark, which ſaved you, as <hi>Noah</hi> did? I dare engage for you, You have more humility and modeſty than to think any ſuch thing: You are convinced, God made a difference where he found none. You hate in this caſe, to ſay, <hi>Ego me ipſum diſcrevi.</hi> You know, no account is to be given of it; But <hi>that God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy:</hi> God who acteth all things according to the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60264:148"/>Counſel of His own Will, hath reaſons for every thing he doth, but we are not worthy to know them. To be ſure, thoſe I did mention were none of them.</p>
                     <p>What a diſtinguiſhing mercy is it, that you have both ſheep and folds, when other Shepherds have neither folds nor ſheep; their folds are burnt, their ſheep are ſcatter'd. Me-thinks it is time, All ſhops of meat are ſhut up, only here, and there one, that hath gotten a licenſe, and what a thing is it, that one of thoſe licenſes ſhould fall to your ſhare, there being ſo few of them as are? When there were Ninty ſeven Churches ſtanding in <hi>London,</hi> had you heard a ſuſpenſion was coming forth (for what reaſon you could not tell) againſt all but twelve or ſixteen of thoſe Ninty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Miniſters, could you have imagined that each of you ſhould have been one of that priviledged number, or as the Diſciples of Chriſt askt him one by one when he told them one ſhould betray him <hi>Maſter is it I?</hi> So would not you have askt, Am not I, one of thoſe that are to be ſuſpended, and in caſe it had proved otherwiſe how thankful would you have been? Such is your caſe now. Others have loſt, and you have gained; Others have no Congregations, and yours are greater then ever (and look like gathered Churches made up of people collected out of ſeveral parts and Pariſhes) which now come to hear you. You have received ſingular favour; doth not God expect you ſhould do ſome ſingular thing? As Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, What ſingular thing do you? Will you not think yours ſelves bound to ſhine with double and treble ſo much light as formerly (if you can poſſibly) now that there are ſo few publick Lights
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60264:149"/>left to ſhine in this part of the firmament. Pray, that the ſpirit of <hi>Elias</hi> may be doubled upon you now that ſo many <hi>Elias</hi>'s (as you your ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them) are taken away by that fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot I have been ſpeaking of. If you ſee ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes in your reſpective Churches as you never ſaw there before, have compaſſion on them as Chriſt had, and labour to ſend them away well fed, and ſatisfied. Your lips are now to preſerve knowledge for many more than they had wont to do; The fire hath given you a kind of Monopoly for preaching in theſe parts, and therefore you muſt needs have the more Auditors; Forfeit not your Patent. I was a ſtranger to ſeveral of you, but others of you I knew, whom I believe to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ingenuous men, partly for whoſe ſake I am glad that thoſe Candleſticks are ſtill in being, which did and do contain ſo ſerviceable Lights. As <hi>Noah</hi> being ſaved from the deluge, did greatly help to increaſe the world; ſo, may you adde daily to the Church <hi>ſuch as ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and then the worſt I wiſh you, is, that a bleſsing from heaven may attend your labours.</p>

                     <head>MEDITATION XXXIII. Upon thoſe Miniſters whoſe Churches were burnt.</head>
                     <p>THere was cauſe to fear ſome years ſince that Churches might be demoliſhed, not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by fire (for of that there was no miſtruſt), but by thoſe whom the Scripture compares to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>viz.</hi> A rude multitude, I mean of deluded and ſick-brain people, who pretended that all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and their legal Maintenance were Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60264:149"/>Churches places of Spiritual whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and could as willingly have pulled them down, as if they had been ſo many Brothel-houſes. Was it any thing but a pretence? could they think as they ſpake? I ſhould hardly believe men could be ſo miſtaken, but that Chriſt foretold ſome would think they ſhould do God good ſervice, even in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Prophets: and <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that when time was he verily thought he ought to do many things againſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> They that thought it their duty to oppoſe and vilifie the places called Churches, would probably have taken it for as great an honour to have demoliſhed them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as others might to have burnt them; but he that ſits in heaven would not gratifie their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but put that work into the hand of the fire to do, which could no ways glory or triumph in it when it was done. But that which I am now to diſcourſe of, is not, by whom but upon whom this Calamity came, <hi>viz.</hi> Concerning the Miniſters whoſe Churches were burnt. Now far be it from me and others to think that they were greater ſinners then other Miniſters whoſe Churches ſtand to this day. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Suppoſe ye that thoſe upon whom the tower of Siloam fell, and ſlew them, were ſinners above all men that dwelt at Jeruſalem; I tell you nay, but except you repent you ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Had theſe Miniſters made Cock-pits of their Pulpits (as ſome elſewhere have done); had they, like <hi>thoſe toes of the cloven foot, which conſiſted partly of Iron, and partly of clay,</hi> (to allude to <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.4.) come thither to trample upon Magiſtracy and Miniſtery, in ſuch rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Language as ſome that I have heard; had they thence, <hi>like mad men, caſt firebrands, arrows and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60264:150"/>death, Prov.</hi> 26.18. truly, for that time, their Churches might have been ſpared; but ſuch were the labours of ſeveral of them, as will certainly be miſſed.</p>
                     <p>Neither can I chuſe, but reflect how dearly ſome of them (as is probable) will miſs their Livings, ſuch I mean as have Wives and Children, and little or nothing to live upon, but what came in that way; Few men make a worſe ſhift in the world than Schollars, eſpecially Miniſters when put out of their courſe; They that have lived as it were out of the world, can worſt of all skill how to live in it. Swords may be beaten into Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, ſo cannot Books; Moreover the liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ingenuouſneſs of the Education of Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars makes them greater objects of pity than many others are, when poverty overtakes them. It is pity, that they who deſire to live, that they may ſtudy, ſhould be put upon ſtudying little elſe, but how to live. One half years time, without the help of a Living, may ſo pinch ſome honeſt Miniſters, who have great Families, as that they can ſcarcely bear it. They may have hope, the graſs will grow again, but they fear, leſt mean time the Steed ſhould ſtarve. What ſhall be done for thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters whom only the fire hath ſequeſtred? How ſhall they be provided for? There is a ſaving of Chriſt in <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.11. which, Analogically ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and practiſed, might go a great way, and it is this, <hi>He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none, &amp; he that hath meat let him do likewiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that which I have more hope of, is, that the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> who either have or ſhortly may have good Livings to diſpoſe of, will lay to heart, how many worthy <hi>Labourers ſtand

                     <p>Had thoſe Churches been either perſectly ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or perfectly demoliſh'd, they could have done no hurt; but, being between both, they were in a capacity to do miſchief; though, as for matter of ſervice, they were in no capacity at all. I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived if it be not juſt ſo with almoſt, but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether-ruin'd Perſons, as with Places of that ſore; Though they can do, or receive little good them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet may they prove incomparably deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to others, (eſpecially in ſuch high-Winds as may blow;) and therefore prudence may ſuggeſt, that ſuch Perſons, as are not judged worthy to be perfectly ruin'd, and, as it were deſtroyed from off the face of the earth, had better be left ſtanding in ſome tolerable condition, than in ſuch a tottering and ruinous way, as, in caſe any violent tempeſt, or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60264:152"/>unexpected Herricaue ſhould happen, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the ruin of many, upon whom they may chance to fall.</p>
                     <p>I cannot diſmiſs this Subject till I have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how ſecurely thoſe Perſons, that were killed by the fall of ruinous-Buildings, may have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have paſſed by them, till perchance their utter-deſtruction gave them the firſt apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their dangers, or rather anticipated the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of it. Alas! How unexpected a gueſt oft-times is Death? How often doth it draw the latch and come in upon men unawares, when they dream of nothing leſs? How comes it like a <hi>thief in the night,</hi> when men are in a profound ſleep of ſecurity? It is like, thoſe People thought, that ſeeing ſo many perſons had gon that way with ſafety the ſelf-ſame-day; yea, it may be the ſelf-ſame-hour; ſo might they, as well as the reſt: But, I ſee, there is no Topick, from which men argue for ſecurity, (how probable ſoever,) but fails them now and then; neither is there any ſafety in probable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, from ſudden death, but only in due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it. As for thoſe, who have often paſſed to and fro the Ruins, and by the ſides of tottering-Walls, but never received any hurt: I wiſh they may conſider, How infinitely they are bound to God for the gracious watchfulneſs of his good Providence over them, and for putting ſo vaſt a difference betwixt them and others, as not to let them loſe one hair of their heads by ruinated-Buildings, whereby others have loſt their lives: And, may ſuch, as have occaſion to paſs-by ſuch places from day to day, duly conſider, That God hath created more dangers than were formerly; and therefore ought they to walk with more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60264:152"/>than they had wont to do, and to be <hi>in the fear of the Lord</hi> all the day long; and to be in readineſs for the worſt that can befall them; as men that carry their lives in their hands, and do walk in the midſt of menacing-perils.

God himſelf being called a fire, it is probable enough, that Angels go by the ſame name, becauſe of the reſemblance which they bear to God, who have more of Gods image than man himſelf though man hath more of it then all other creatures. The Chariots of fire which <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaw, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.17.

What a comfort is it that God hath ſuch nimble Meſſengers to diſpatch upon any expedition for our good? An hoſt of Angels can be with us preſently, even as ſoon as lightning can glance thorough the air. It is well for believers that Angels are ſo powerful that they excell in ſtrength, ſeeing they are theirs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to miniſter for their good.

                     <p>HOw ſhall we underſtand that queſtion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.29. <hi>It not my word like as a fire ſaith the Lord?</hi> Wherein conſiſts the reſemblance betwixt the word of God and fire? Surely it's warnting the hearts of men in whom it takes place, is one reaſon of it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo called: For ſo ſaid the Diſciples of Chriſt <hi>Did not our hearts even burn within us, whilſt he opened the Scriptures to us?</hi> Luk. 24.32. Or elſe it may be ſo called from it's efficacy; in which ſenſe it is alſo called a Hammer <hi>which breaketh the rocks in pieces:</hi> Fire is able to demoliſh the ſtrongeſt places, of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we many have ſad inſtances at this day; &amp; ſo the Word is ſaid to be mighty through God to pull down ſtrong holds. We read of Gold tried by fire, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. and is not the Word of God a trying thing? It is ſaid (I ſhall not here examine in what ſenſe) that <hi>God ſent forth his word and tried</hi> Joſeph. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.19. Who knows not the purifying nature of fire, whereby metals are refined? and did not Chriſt aſcribe the like virtue to his Word, ſaying, <hi>Now are ye clean through the word that I have ſpoken to you?</hi> What more piercing then fire, and in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eſpect alſo, it is much an Embleme of the Word of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60264:158"/>God, which is ſaid, to be <hi>ſharper than a two-edged ſword piercing to the dividing a-ſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow,</hi> Heb. 4.12.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are but ſome of the Parallels that might be made, betwixt the word of God and Fire. He, whoſe word it is, would have it to be as Fire. And if it be Fire, where it hath once broken out, and got head, it will be hard to ſmother or ſuppreſſe it (as that Evangelical Fire, which was kindled by <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> could never be extinguiſhed to this day). Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, though he <hi>ſuffered bonds, yet the word of God was not bound,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.

It is not Gods word, but ſomething elſe thoſe men would have, who would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preached to them, that ſhould be as fire to conſume their Luſts, or to make their conſciences ſmart, at the remembrance of them. That which is not apt to ſearch and pierce, is nothing akin to fire, and therefore cannot be the word of God, which is ſaid to be <hi>quick and powerful</hi> as fire its ſelf. The fires which God kindleth for the good of the world (whereof his word is one of the chief) woe be to any that ſhall go about to quench. Quenching of prophecying is next unto quenching of the Spirit, yea, and is one way of doing it, as Divines ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>

                     <p>I ſee cauſe, to bleſſe the God of heaven, who hath created ſome fires as profitable as others are miſchievous, namely, his word for one, a fire that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth hurt, otherwiſe than by accident (neither indeed would other fires, kept within their due bounds) but ſo much good, as no tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. O Lord, that through thine inſinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I might experiment in my ſelf and others, all thoſe excellent properties of fire meeting in thy word, of which I have now been ſpeaking; that my heart and theirs might burn within us at the hearing of it, as did the hearts of thy Diſciples, that it may be mighty through thee to pull down all the ſtrong-holds of Sin and Sathan that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, that it might trye us as gold is tryed in the fire, and at the ſame time reſined and puriſied; that it might pierce, unto the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow; that the ſin, which is, as it were, bred in our bones, may be gotten out of the very fleſh. May the fire of thy word, have ſuch influence as this upon us, we ſhall then be ſure to eſcape the fire of thy wrath, and to arrive to that happineſs, which is called, <hi>The inheritance of the Saints in Light, Col.</hi> 1.12.</p>

                     <p>ME-thinks the ſeveral Conduits that were in <hi>London,</hi> ſtood like ſo many little (but ſtrong) Forts, to confront and give check, to that great enemy, Fire, if any occaſion ſhould be. There,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60264:159"/>me-thinks the water was, as it were, intrenched and ingarriſoned. The ſeveral Pipes and Vehicles of water, that were within thoſe Conduits, all of them charged with water, till, by the turning of the Cocks, they were diſcharged again; were, as ſo many Souldiers within thoſe Forts, with their Muſquets charged, and ready to be diſcharged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the drawing of their ſeveral Cocks, to keep and defend thoſe places. And look how Enemies are wont to deal with thoſe Caſtles, which they take to be impregnable, and diſpair of ever get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by ſtorm, <hi>viz.</hi> to attempt the ſtarving of them by a cloſe Siege, intercepting all proviſion of Victuals from coming at them; ſo went the fire to work with thoſe little Caſtles of ſtone, which were not eaſie for it to burn down (witneſs their ſtanding to this day); ſpoiled them or almoſt ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them it hath for preſent, by cutting off thoſe ſupplies of water, which had wont to ſlow to them, melting thoſe leaden Channels, in which the water had wont to be conveyed to them, and thereby, as it were, ſtarving thoſe Garriſons, which they could not take by ſtorm.</p>
                     <p>What the Scripture ſpeaks of the Land of <hi>Jordan,</hi> that <hi>it was well watered every where,</hi> before the Lord deſtroyed <hi>Sodom, even as the Garden of the Lord,</hi> like the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> (made fruitful by the River <hi>Nilus);</hi> the ſame might have been ſaid of <hi>London</hi> before this fire, It was watered like <hi>Paradiſe</hi> its ſelf: yea, whereas <hi>Paradiſe</hi> had but one River, (though <hi>it parted into four heads, Gen.</hi> 2.10.) <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> had two at leaſt, deviding its ſelf, or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into many branches, and diſperſing its ſelf ſeveral wayes. For, beſides the noble River of <hi>Thames,</hi> gliding not only by the ſides, but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60264:159"/>the bowels of <hi>London,</hi> there was another, called the <hi>New-River,</hi> brought from <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> thither, by the induſtry and ingenuity of that worthy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be forgotten Knight, Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> the ſpring of whoſe deſerved fame is ſuch, as the late Fire its ſelf (though the dreadfulleſt of all that we have known) hath not, nor will not be able to dry up; but continue it will, a Fountain of praiſe and honour, bubling up to all poſterity.</p>
                     <p>As nature, by Veins and Arteries, ſome great, ſome ſmall, placed up and down all parts of the Body, miniſtreth blood and nouriſhment to every member thereof, and part of each member; ſo was that wholſome Water, which was as neceſſary for the good of <hi>London,</hi> as blood is for the life and health of the body, conveyed by Pipes, wooden or metalline, as by ſo many veins into all parts of that famous City. If water were, as we may call it, the blood of <hi>London,</hi> then were its ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits, as it were, the Liver and Spleen of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which are reckoned as the Fountains of blood in humane bodies) for that the great Trunks of veins conveying blood about the body, are ſeated there, as great Roots fixed in the Earth, ſhooting out their branches divers and ſundry wayes. But alas! how were thoſe Livers inflamed, and how unfit have they been ſince to do their wonted Office? What pity it is, to ſee thoſe breaſts of <hi>London</hi> (for ſo I may alſo call them) almoſt dryed up: and the poor Citizens mean time ſo loth as they are, to be wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their former place. They were lovely ſtreams indeed, which did refreſh that noble City, one of which was alwayes at work, pouring out its ſelf when the reſt lay ſtill.</p>
                     <p>As if the Fire had been angry with the poor
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60264:160"/>old Tankard-bearers, both Men and Women, for propagating that Element which was contrary to it; and carrying it upon their ſhoulders as it were in State and Triumph; it hath even deſtroyed their Trade, and threatned to make them periſh by fire, who had wont to live by water. Seeing there are few or none to ſuck thoſe Breaſts at this day, the matter is not ſo great; if they be almoſt empty and dry at preſent, may they but ſill again, and their Milk be renewed, ſo ſoon as the honeſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſhall come again to their former ſcituations. O Lord, that it might be thy good pleaſure to let <hi>London</hi> be firſt reſtor'd, and ever after preſerved from Fire; and when once reſtored, let it be as plentifully and commodiouſly ſupplied with water as ever it was formerly: Make it once again as the Paradiſe of God; but never ſuffer any deſtroying Serpent any more to come there.</p>

                     <p>ME-thinks I hear ſome <hi>Reman-Catholicks,</hi> (as they are pleaſed to call themſelves,) ſaying, Some of your Proteſtants did confidently foretel, That within this preſent year 1666 <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould down; <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould fall; Antichriſt ſhould be deſtroyed: But, now your own City is deſtroyed in the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame-year; which (according to you) doth ſhow, that <hi>London</hi> was the true-<hi>Babylon,</hi> and that the true Antichriſt is amongſt your ſelves. Yet, upon due examination, it will be found, that there is as little ſtrength in the Argument which they have brought,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60264:160"/>as there is ſenſe in the name whereby they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>viz. Roman-Catholicks:</hi> which is as much as to ſay, Members of the particular Univerſal-Church; or of that part of the Church which is the whole; or of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is all the World. VVe read of <hi>Names of blaſphemy which were upon the heads of the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.1. But, as if that were not ſufficient they have added a Name, which is perfect non-ſenſe for the reaſon aforeſaid; but, that by the way. Their deſign is, to prove, that Antichriſt is amongſt us; and, that <hi>London</hi> was that Myſtical-<hi>Balylon</hi> ſo often ſpoken of, according to what was lately found in a Seditious Libel; <hi>Do to South-Babel, &amp;c.</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Southern-part of <hi>London</hi> yet ſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But alaſs! How weak are the Premiſſes from which they have drawn theſe concluſions.</p>
                     <p>Their Argument put into a Syllogiſm, is this; If <hi>London</hi> were deſtroyed the ſelf-ſame-year in which ſome did Propheſie that <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed; then is <hi>London</hi> that which the Scripture calls <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> amongſt the Proteſtants: But <hi>London</hi> was, <hi>&amp;c.

VVere they not a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Enthuſiaſtical Men, to whom, not one Proteſtant of a thouſand gave credit? For, believe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60264:161"/>me, Enthuſiaſts and Proteſtants are no convertible terms; foraſmuch as not every hundredth or thouſandth Proteſtant is any thing of an Enthuſiaſt. VVe do not uſe to charge upon your Church the Extravagant Bablings of one or a few particular Papiſts, but the profeſſed Doctrines and Tenets of that which yourſelves call the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Do us the ſame right, and forbear to charge upon Proteſtants, as ſuch, what the Proteſtant Church doth diſavow.</p>
                     <p>Poſſibly they were ſome of your own Religion, ſome Romaniſts, putting on the mask of Proteſtants (as hath bin uſual with them to do, for ſiniſter ends) who foreknowing, that <hi>London</hi> would be burnt this year (as nothing is more eaſy, than for men to know what themſelves intend to do) gave out, that <hi>Babylon</hi> and Anti-chriſt would be deſtroyed in ſixty ſix, for that very end, that when they had once effected the burying of <hi>London</hi> in aſhes, they might have ſome pretence to write this Epitaph, <hi>Here lies Babylon,</hi> here lies that which was the feat of the true Anti-chriſt; thereby rolling away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Babylon</hi> and Anti-chriſt from themſelves to whom it belongs, upon the Proteſtants whom it concerns not.</p>
                     <p>But take heed how you deny Anti-chriſt to be amongſt you, for by that means you quit one Argument,

                           <hi>Sir.</hi> Edw. Sand. <hi>Spec. Europ.</hi>
                        </note> which ſome of your writers have uſed to prove <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, for that it is ſaid, that <hi>Anti-chriſt ſitteth in the Temple of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. But, if upon further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you would not be known to have Anti-chriſt amongſt you, let me tell you, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſpoken of in Scripture, is ſo thoroughly markt, that it is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60264:161"/>eaſy to diſtinguiſh him from the Proteſtant Church, and from <hi>Rome</hi> heatheniſh and whatſoever elſe he would turn over his name to. Me-thinks that one Text, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. would plainly enough decipher Anti-chriſt, if there were none but that, <hi>Who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> or that is worſhipped; ſo that he, as God, ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. The Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi>-heatheniſh ſate not in the Temple of God, they were not within the pales of the profeſſedly Chriſtian Church, therefore they were not the man of ſin, and Anti-chriſt there ſpoken of, but he is to be ſought and found amongſt thoſe that are called Chriſtians. Now amongſt Chriſtians there are none that exalt themſelves above all that are called God, that is, above all Magiſtrates which are called Gods, challenging a Primacy and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy to themſelvs over all Chriſtians, both Subjects and Princes; I ſay there are none that do ſo, but the Popes of Rome ſucceſſively: whence it comes to paſs that Papiſts are wont to refuſe the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy to their Native Prince, as believing not their own Prince to be Supream under God over his own Subjects, but the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> over both him and them. Moreover, who is it that fitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf to be God, that is, aſſumeth to himſelf thoſe things which are proper and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to God onely, as namely, To forgive ſins? For none can forgive ſins but God onely: I ſay, who, but the reſpective Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> do take upon them by their own power, and in their own name to forgive ſin: the groſsneſs of which practice did firſt provoke <hi>Luther,</hi> of a ſtaff Monk, to become a zealous Proteſtant. Yea, who amognſt thoſe that were called Chriſtians, did ever exalt himſelf above
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60264:162"/>all that is worſhipped (by which may be meant the true God), ſaving the reſpective Popes of <hi>Rome?</hi> And they have done it time after time in taking upon them to diſpenſe with the Commiſſion of ſin, as with the taking of unlawful Oaths, and ſuch like. Now God himſelf though he remit ſin to ſuch as truly believe, and repent; yet he never did, nor, by reaſon of the holineſs of his nature, ever could give men free leave, and licence to do that which is ſinful. It is true that God gave the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites Commiſſion to borrow the Jewels and Earings of the Egyptians, and never to return them again: but that was not a liberty to ſteal; for God, Whoſe all thoſe things were, and whoſe are all things, was pleaſed to alienate the propriety; to take thoſe things from the Egyptians, and give them to the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.</p>
                     <p>A fourth Character of Anti-chriſt, is, that his Coming is, with lying wonders, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. that is, with feigned miracles. Now who amongſt all that are called Chriſtians, trade ſo much (if at all) in thoſe things, as doth the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> How do the Romaniſts (they and only they) abound with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and all fictitious, and no other then groſs impoſture? Tell thoſe people that have no Bibles to conſult, but what are in an unknown language or elſe perverted by a falſe tranſlation, or a corrupt gloſs, I ſay, tell them the Anti-chriſt is amongſt the proteſtants, and that <hi>London</hi> was the Myſtical <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> of which the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Sic notus Ulyſſes?</hi> Is Anti-chriſt no better known, think you, to them that have ſeen his Picture and Deſcription in holy Writ. Alas! ſuch coarſe Wares as is the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aſſerting of <hi>London</hi> to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> will go off no where, but in a dark ſhop, or by a falſe light.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60264:162"/>Your blinded Moſes, that live as it were under ground, may be made to believe that <hi>Rome</hi> is the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. and <hi>London</hi> what ever you pleaſe to call it, or any thing elſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you ſhall think fit to delude them by thoſe artifices which you call Pious-Frands (which is as proper an expreſſion as Pious-Devils): but our people converſe with the Sun, I mean the light of Scripture. They have read the book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> of Saint <hi>John,</hi> and though they do not pretend to underſtand every thing therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, yet they doubt not what is meant by <hi>the beaſt's having ſeven heads and ten horns,</hi> Rev. 13.1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they find Saint <hi>John</hi> himſelf expounding it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The ſeven heads are ſeven mountains.</hi> And there are ſeven Kings (that is, Forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) <hi>Five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe paſſages agree &amp; quadrate to <hi>Rome</hi> exactly. It was built upon ſeven Hills yet to be ſeen, though ſome of them be now without the walls of the City. It had ſeven forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof five were fallen in Saints <hi>John</hi>'s time, <hi>viz.</hi> Kings, Conſuls, Tribunes, Decemvir's, Dictators: one is, ſaith he, that is, Emperors were then in being, the other was not yet come, <hi>viz.</hi> Popes. But do theſe expreſsions, all or any of them, agree to <hi>London,</hi> as they agree to <hi>Rome?</hi> Doth that ſtand upon juſt ſeven hills? Hath that had juſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forms of Government, five whereof were fallen in Saint <hi>John</hi>'s time, and one other in being? With what face then can you affirm <hi>London</hi> to be <hi>Babylon?</hi> But I ſee, Thoſe men have impudence enough to aſſert any thing, who have taught their followers to believe every thing they pleaſe to aſſert.</p>

                     <p>A faith of Legends (and only that) may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to aſſure men that <hi>London</hi> was Myſtical-Babylon; for that I take to be more than a faith of Miracles: the latter being a ſaith of Poſsibles, the other of Impoſsibilities and contradictions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though ſome of the ſillier ſort of Papiſts may believe, and others may boldly aſſert the ſame though they believe it not (as they do in many other caſes): yet Proteſtants can never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it whilſt the world ſtands; nor any other perſons, that are from under the power of groſs Ignorance, or Prejudice: As for the name Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, Who knows not that it imports one that ſets himſelf in the ſtead or place of Chriſt, as well as againſt Chriſt; the Praepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

Now, Who amongſt thoſe that are called Proteſtants, can be charged with ſetting himſelf in the place of Chriſt, as if he would be taken for Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? But that do the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceſsively, whilſt they affirm to themſelves, thoſe things which are peculiar to Chriſt alone, as namely Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, &amp;c. I had forborn this diſcourſe, but that I have been advertiſed of the reproaches of ſome of the Papiſts, who, after the Baptiſm of fire we have lately undergone, go about to Baptize us, and our City, with their ſpittle, by the names of <hi>Babylon</hi> and Anti-chriſt, due only to <hi>Rome,</hi> and Romaniſts: and God forbid that whilſt Papiſts do unjuſtly aſperſe Proteſtants (whoſe Religion is that which the Laws of <hi>England</hi> doth eſtabliſh) Proteſtants ſhould not have leave, and take heart enough to vindicate themſelves. In a word, if <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> be Myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> (ſo confident am I it is not), let it never riſe again; if <hi>Rome</hi> be not, let it

Poſſibly ſome weak and inconſiderate perſons, that ſaw His Majeſty at that time ſtooping ſo low, might in their hearts deſpiſe Him for it, (as <hi>Michal</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> for leaping and dancing before the Ark, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.16. and 20.) ſaying in deriſion, <hi>How glorious was the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>to day?</hi> as ſhe, <hi>How glorious was the King of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But wiſe and religious perſons, that had ſeen <hi>David</hi> in that poſture, would have ſpoken the ſame words in good earneſt, which ſhe ſpake in ſcorn, meaning, as they ſaid, <hi>How glorious indeed was the King of</hi> Iſrael, whilſt, tranſported with holy zeal, he leapt before the Ark, which is called, <hi>Dancing before the Lord?</hi> The like can I ſay from mine heart of our Dread Soveraign: <hi>How glorious was He</hi> in truth, and in reality, when He took upon Him the form, or rather the work of a mean-man; and vouchſafed His helping Hand to ſtop that diſmal Fire, when it was in its full carreer? Had I ſeen
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60264:164"/>Him with His Crown upon His Head, His Scepter in His Hand, His Noble Senators all waiting upon Him in their Parliament-Robes, or in all the State in which He could have been ſeen, (<hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11.) either on the day of His Coronation, or of His Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſals; I could not have reverenced Him more than I ſhould have done, if I had beheld Him with a Bucket in His Hand, pouring water upon the Flames; or than I do, ſo often as I think of Him in ſome ſuch poſture of moſt kind and obliging condeſcenſion. Me-thinks it was but equal that Chriſt ſhould be more loved, but not leſs honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he humbled himſelf ſo far, as to take a <hi>Towel,</hi> and therewith <hi>to waſh, and to wipe his Diſciples feet,</hi> John 13.4.</p>
                     <p>Kings never act more like themſelves than when they are doing good to their Subjects, and are ſnatching them, or their Concerns, as fire-brands out of the Fire: forasmuch as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That Magiſtrates are the Miniſters of God to thoſe that are under them for good,</hi> Rom. 13.4. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperors had wont to iſſue out their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to their Soldiers, not in the third, but in the firſt Perſon: So <hi>Pertinax</hi> his Word and Motto was <hi>Militemus;</hi> not, <hi>March ye;</hi> but, <hi>Let us March on;</hi> (including himſelf.) So <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> his word was <hi>Laboremus, Let us be doing.</hi> In like manner, our Gracious Soveraign is ſaid to have ſtretcht forth His own Royal Hands to aſſiſt the putting out of thoſe Aſpiring Flames, which ſeemed to expect a Princely Extinguiſher: That was ſuch a kind of Royal Aid, as all Subjects muſt needs be in love with; and, Why not more free to that other, which goes by ſuch a name in the remembrance of this? One of the Ancients did wiſh, to have ſeen
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60264:164"/>
                        <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Fleſh, <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pulpit, and <hi>Rome</hi> in its ancient Glory. Much rather, at leſt-wiſe than the laſt of theſe, would I have ſeen that ſight I am now ſpeaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> His moſt Excellent Majeſty beſtirring Himſelf, to give check to thoſe Flames which threatned to lay both His great City and Suburbs all in aſhes. Who had the faces to ſtand ſtill and look on, (as many did at other times,) whilſt their Soveraign Himſelf was ſo imployed? Whilſt Princes work, Subjects cannot have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to be idle. Oh the power and efficacy of Princely Examples! <hi>Regis ad exemplum,</hi> &amp;c. When Princes will help to extinguiſh fires themſelves, the work is like to ſucceed; and when that is done, the greateſt thanks are due to them, next unto the King of Kings.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh, there were not many other fires at this day within the Bowels of this Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> of fears and jealouſies, envy and emulation, wrath and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, diſſatisfaction and diſcontent, diſſenſion and diviſion: May he, who is the <hi>Wonderful, Counſellor,</hi> and <hi>God only wiſe,</hi> inſtruct His Majeſty, how, and which way to extinguiſh them: and mean-time to increaſe one other fire (and only that) <hi>viz.</hi> of love and affection; firſt to God, nextly to Himſelf, and then amongſt all his Subjects one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells of <hi>a poor man, who by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſaved a little City, when a great king came againſt it, and beſieged it,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.14. By this means may His Majeſty ſave, and preſerve, not only one City but three Kingdoms, which thoſe fires threaten to deſtroy: (for our Saviour tells us, <hi>That a kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand:</hi>) And though <hi>no man remembred that poor man</hi> (becauſe he was poor) yet when a more glorious action ſhall be done by a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60264:165"/>Princely hand, ſurely no man will or can forget it. Will it not be a conſiderable acceſſion of honour even to a great King, to be inrolled amongſt the Peace-makers, whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> pronounceth <hi>bleſſed?</hi> As for His Majeſties inclination to all ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, as ſweetneſs of temper may induce men to, let all His Subjects be well perſwaded of, by the tears he ſhed, when he beheld the Flames of <hi>London,</hi> which I had not reported but from a very credible Author. How amiable a ſight is it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Kings weeping over the miſeries of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and what aſſurance doth it give, that they will not be backward to redreſs them ſo far as is within their power? Had His <hi>head been a fountain of tears,</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> upon occaſion wiſht his own,) I doubt not but he had poured it forth when he came near to <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> with reſolution to do all a King could do to put out thoſe flames: May we alwayes ſee a bleſſed contention betwixt our King and his People, Which ſhall moſt reſent and bewail each others ſufferings; Which ſhall moſt promote and rejoyce in each others happineſs!</p>

Nextly, the fire upon <hi>Sodom</hi> (and the three other Cities conſumed with it) deſtroyed not only a major part of thoſe Cities but the whole. But the Beeſom of deſtruction, which ſwept <hi>London,</hi> did not ſweep ſo clean but God hath left ſome ſmall remnant of City, that it might not be like <hi>Sodom,</hi> and like <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morniſh, Iſai.</hi> 1.9. Thirdly, the fire upon <hi>Sedom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> did conſume, not only places, but perſons; not only four Cities, but the greateſt part of their inhabitants, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.25. But to the praiſe of diſtinguiſhing-mercy be it ſpoken, the inhabitants of <hi>London</hi> were generally ſnatcht as fire-brands out of the fire, and ſo was part of their ſubſtance. Fourthly, <hi>Sodom and Gomarah are ſaid to ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> Jude 7. Which expreſſion, ſo far as it is refer'd to the places them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, doth ſignifie that they were irrecoverably deſtroyed by fire, ſo as that they ſhall eternally lie waſt. But concerning <hi>London,</hi> we hope and have
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60264:169"/>reaſon to hope better things, and that ſhe may ſay to her inſulting enemies, <hi>Rejoyce not over me; For though I fall, yet ſhall I riſe again,</hi> &amp;c. Fifthly,</p>
                     <p>As if one deſtruction had been too little (and that by ſire too) <hi>Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah,</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boim,</hi> were deſtroyed by water alſo; that whole Countrey being turned into a ſtanding ſtinking Lake, <hi>which at this day is called the Dead Sea,</hi> and in the Scripture <hi>the ſalt-ſea, Gen.</hi> 14.3. Though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it was <hi>even as the garden of God, or as the land of Egypt for fruitfulneſs,</hi> Gen. 14.10. The Salt-ſea it is ſuppoſed to be called from the Sulphurous combuſtions, firſt occaſioning it: and the Dead-ſea, becauſe the Charnel-houſe of ſo many dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, then deſtroyed therein, or becauſe it is quickned by no viſible motion, or becauſe it kills all creatures that come into it. Several marks of God's curſe it retains to this day. Though it be a Sea, yet neither can fiſhes live in it, nor ſhips ſail in it, neither hath it intercourſe with any other ſeas or communion with the Ocean, leſt it ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect other waters with its malignity, neither doth any healthful thing grow thereon; God having blaſted it (as it were) as Chriſt did the barren fig-tree. <hi>Solinus</hi> calls it a Melancholy Bay, which the black-ſoil thereof, being alſo turned into aſhes, witneſſeth to have been blaſted from heaven. I read of nothing that appeareth good in &amp; about <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſince its deſtruction, but a certain Apple, and that doth but appear ſo neither; for though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear fair to the eye, yet within the rind of it, is nothing but an Ember-like Soot, which being lightly preſſed evaporates into ſmoak, and becomes duſt.

                     <p>TIme was, when that place which was ſince called <hi>London,</hi> went by the name of new-<hi>Troy,</hi> and as it ſometimes bore the ſame name, ſo they both came to the ſame end, <hi>viz.</hi> by fire. Old <hi>Troy</hi> was fired not accidentally, but wilfully and by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and ſo ſome think was New-<hi>Troy,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>London.</hi> Admit the ſtory of <hi>Troy</hi> be partly fictitious (as things related by Poets are ſuſpected to be) yet give me leave to moralize it as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Is is reported, that <hi>Priamus</hi> giving leave to his Son <hi>Paris,</hi> to raviſh <hi>Helena,</hi> Wife to <hi>Menelaus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> was that which forced the Greeks, who burnt <hi>Troy,</hi> to renew their ancient quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. I think, there have been ſew Tragedies
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60264:170"/>acted in the world, but the luſt of the fleſh hath born a ſhare in, and been one great occaſion of them. I cannot ſay, it was that which did provoke men to burn <hi>London,</hi> if it were done by wilfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had not the Gates of <hi>London</hi> been ſet too wide open for ſuch treacherous <hi>Greeks</hi> to enter in, poſsibly that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City had been ſtanding to this very day. But what was a Proverb concerning <hi>Trojans, Sero ſapiunt Phryges,</hi> The <hi>Trojans</hi> uſe to be wiſe when it is too late, was too applicable to our ſelves. We begin to wiſh the gates of <hi>London</hi> had been ſhut againſt ſuch dangerous Perſons, when alaſs! in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it hath no Gates to ſhut. It is likely, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that lay Couchant before, in the Belly of the Woodden-horſe, are now not without greater hopes than ever that they ſhall get up and ride. <hi>But he that ſits in heaven can make</hi> the ſecond of <hi>September</hi> produce them as little good, as did their infamous fifth of <hi>November.</hi> But why was it that <hi>London</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the ſame means as was old <hi>Troy?</hi> Will any ſay that the old Proverb, that ſuch a one is a truſty <hi>Trojan,</hi> was as applicable to the new <hi>Trojans,</hi> as to the old? I do not think that was the reaſon.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60264:171"/>For though there might be ſome faithleſs men in <hi>London</hi> (as there are in all places;) yet I doubt not, but <hi>Londoners</hi> (take one with another) might and may ſafely be truſted, as far as any ſort of men; and have as much Faith and Conſcience amongſt them as is elſewhere to be ſound.

                     <p>MAny Prodigies there were, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that went before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> by <hi>Fire,</hi> namely, that a great Gate of the Temple, which twenty men could hardly pull open, opened of its own accord; and, that an <hi>Oxe</hi> brought forth a <hi>Lamb</hi> in the Temple; with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, which I forbear to mention: Theſe were dark Texts for men to expound, yet, ſome did venture to give the ſenſe and meaning of them, as if each of them had been a token for good, whereas the event did manifeſt the quite contrary.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60264:172"/>good conſtruction upon thoſe ill-Signes, as if they had been fore-runners of the good things, which they themſelves expected in the year -66; though as to their enemies they might have an ill-aſpect, and ominous ſignification: Thus far ſome involved themſelves in the ſame practiſe with the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, and God hath involved them in the ſame kind of calamity. It is dangerous doing as <hi>Jews,</hi> leſt we ſuffer as they.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides Prodigies, there were alſo ſundry Propheſies, which did precede the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem. Chriſt</hi> fore-told it at large, as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſeveral <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.44.</note> with the ſeveral antecedents and concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of it; how, <hi>That the Sun ſhould be darkned, and the Moon not give her light,</hi> Matt. 24.29. There were alſo humane Propheſies concerning it, as particularly by that Man, who ran thorough the Streets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and cried <hi>Woe to it</hi> ſeveral dayes together; which, conſidering what <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf had ſaid, was at no hand to be ſlighted. We find no Text in Scripture Propheſying the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>London,</hi> and in ſuch a year; but I have heard that ſome did conſidently aſſert, before any thing of the Fire did happen, that <hi>London</hi> would be burnt in the year -66: as others had done, that it would be viſited with a great Plague in -65: VVhich things coming to paſs accordingly, may reaſonably incline us to believe, that God, (though by what way and means we know not,) had imparted the fore-knowledg of that Event to ſuch as did perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily Propheſie concerning it: For, though it be too much credulouſneſs to believe a Human Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie before it be fulfilled; yet to diſ-believe, that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60264:172"/>it was a real Propheſie, when it is fulfilled, is on the other hand too much moroſeneſs and incredulity: It is not unuſual with God to reveal to one or other thoſe great and ſtrange things which he is about to do in the VVorld; though becauſe there are many falſe pretenders to Revelations, we ought to ſuſpend our belief of ſuch things delivered to us by others, till the event do atteſt them.</p>
                     <p>The burning of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at leaſtwiſe of the Temple, is ſaid to have been begun by one of <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patian</hi>'s Souldiers, contrary to his known will and pleaſure; but, when it was once begun, there were many more that did help it forward, with an eye to gain and plunder. So the burning of <hi>London</hi> ſeems to have taken its firſt riſe from one hand, <hi>viz.</hi> His that ſuffered for it; but is vehemently preſumed to have been earried on by many more of the ſame ſtamp: Before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſet on fire, it had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured a cloſe Siege, and a terrible Fire, of which thouſands, yea millions of People died. No Siege or Famine, (bleſſed be God!) but a very terrible Plague is well known to have pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eded the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>London.</hi> One judgment going off without its deligned effect, doth not exempt men from, but tranſmit them to another; as, where one of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s Plagues ended, another began, he ſtill <hi>refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go.</hi> Some part of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was left ſtanding, <hi>viz.</hi> the Weſt-end of the Wall, and three Towers for their ſtrength and beauty, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the command of <hi>Titus,</hi> to bear teſtimony of the ſtatelineſs of the City to poſterity. So, by the Providence of God, was, and is a tenth part of <hi>London,</hi> or thereabouts, preſerved to this day, as it were, in memorial of what <hi>London</hi> was. It muſt needs be confeſſed, that the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
                        <pb n="821" facs="tcp:60264:173"/>was far greater than that of <hi>London,</hi> all things conſidered; becauſe millions of <hi>Jews</hi> were put to the ſword, beſides ſeveral other cruelties that were inflicted upon others of them; one where of was, that upon a miſtruſt that ſome of them had ſwallowed gold, two thouſand of them were ript up by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hoping to have rob'd thoſe Mines, which made them Goldſinders, but not in ſuch a ſenſe as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have been. Theſe were aggravations of miſery, which Londoners were exempted from (thanks to His infinite goodneſs, who in judgement was pleaſed to remember mercy). But it is not ſo much the diſparity as the parallel betwixt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and of <hi>London,</hi> that I aim to ſpeak of; whereof I ſhall adde two inſtances: one is this, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> were both fired in the ſame moneth, <hi>viz. Septemter;</hi> which moneth hiſtory informs us to have been fatal to many other Cities, and, as I take it, to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> more then once. Laſtly, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſet on fire, by <hi>Romans:</hi> and, as is ſtrongly ſuſpected, <hi>By Romaniſts</hi> too was <hi>London</hi> burnt. If it were otherwiſe, may their Innocency appear, and may thoſe worthy Patriots, who had the matter under examination, acquit them before all the world.</p>

                     <p>VVHo knows not, that the method which men uſed in removing, was, firſt to ſend away their VVifes and Children, (as being their greateſt

Next to them, their care was for their Shop-goods, and firſt for thoſe that were of greateſt price. In a word, what things men did moſt value, thoſe they did labour in the firſt place to ſecure, deferring the removal of their lumber to the very laſt, ſo that for want of time much of that was conſumed. So <hi>Jacob,</hi> prizing <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> and her Children above the reſt of his family, took the greateſt care to ſecure them, by putting them in the rear of his Company, when he went out to meet his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> coming againſt him in a hoſtile way; <hi>but the handmaids and their Children he put in the front</hi> (and, as it were, in the forlorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope) expoſing them to moſt danger, for whom he had leaſt love and reſpect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.2.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60264:174"/>than others. Thoſe ſhould moſt of all be contended for.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome enemies to our Religion, which would not onely build with hay and ſtubble, but even lay another Foundation beſides that which is laid, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, though other Foundation, that will bear, can no man lay, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. Such ſhould moſt of all be contended againſt. For, others are but diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately oppoſite to us, as Green to Yellow, and other intermediate colours are to White; but ſuch, are as quite contrary to us, as Black can be to White. Some Duties there are, the performance whereof are, as it were, the very Pillars of a Church, which it cannot ſtand without. Others again, are for their nature more diſputable, for their uſe more indifferent and leſſe neceſſary. God forbid, but the firſt of theſe ſhould alwayes take place of the laſt, and that we may more regard thoſe things of which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Theſe things ought you to have done;</hi> and then thoſe other, of which he ſpeaketh more diminutively, ſaying, <hi>And the other you ſhould not have left undone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are certain ſins, which, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How prepoſterous would it be to puniſh peccadil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's with Scorpions, and let ſuch crimes of the firſt magnitude ſcarce be puniſhed with Rods? What men did in relation to the Fire, may ever teach them, to mind thoſe things in the firſt place, which are of greateſt conſequence. If men had Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and Gun-powder in the ſame Shop, did they not ſtrive to remove their Gun-powder before their Iron, becauſe that would do moſt hurt. It
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60264:174"/>is the Apoſtle's rule, that all things ſhould be done decently and in order. To begin with thoſe things which are moſt neceſſary, and then proceed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to thoſe which are of leſs conſequence, is one of the moſt neceſſary pieces of Order that can be obſerved. It is a good rule, that we ſhould firſt do thoſe things that muſt be done, and afterwards thoſe that may be done. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was overſeen in preſenting <hi>Ephraim</hi> to his Father's left hand, and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> to his right; and <hi>Jacob</hi> obſerving it, laid his right hand upon <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and his left upon <hi>Manaſſeh, Gen.</hi> 48.14. In like manner, there is frequent cauſe for us to croſs our hands, and place our right where we are moved to place our left; nothing being more incident to us, than to mind thoſe things in the laſt, which we ought to regard in the firſt place. By as good reaſon as men ſecured their Wives and Children before their goods, their Gold and Silver before their lumber, ought men, who know their ſouls to be more worth than all other things, firſt of all to ſecure them from that worm that never-dyes, from that fire that never will go out.</p>

                     <p>SO it was, that ſome who attempted to viſit the Ruines and Reliques of thoſe Houſes in which they dwelt, (not above a week before,) though they found the Street in which they ſtood, yet had much ado to be certain which was the ground they ſtood upon. He that ſhould have told them but
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60264:175"/>one day before the Fire began, that within five or ſix dayes, they being in <hi>London,</hi> and in the ſame Street where their dwelling was, ſhould not be able to find the way to their own Houſes, (where they had lived, it may be, twenty years and upwards,) would have been lookt upon as mad, or replied to in ſome ſuch language as this; What ſhould aile us? Shall we be out of our wits within that time? or, Shall we be ſtruck with blindneſs as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were, that ſought for <hi>Lots</hi> door? or, if ſo, we think we could find our own Houſes blindfold, or in the darkeſt night, at ſo ſmall a diſtance: or, Shall <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> be changed as much as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> which were fair Cities, but are now a filthy Lake: Or how, and by what means ſhould it be ſo much altered? He did not more expreſs his admiration and disbelief of what was foretold in another caſe, who ſaid, <hi>If God would make Windows in Heaven, how could this be?</hi> than moſt men would have expreſſed theirs as to this: Yet do we ſee the thing, which could enter into no mans heart to conceive, till he ſaw it is come to paſs. Methinks it is ſad to hear men, that knew <hi>London</hi> well enough before, as they walk along the Ruins, asking at every turn, Which is the way to ſuch a place? and, What ſtreet is this? and, What Street is that? But yet more ſad, to think of men, that have ſought their own Houſes, not far from the place where they had wont to ſtand, and could not eaſily find them. There is a phraſe in Scripture, of <hi>Mens places knowing them no more:</hi> but, in this caſe that phraſe was inverſed, <hi>viz. Men, for the time, knew their places no more.</hi> Oh ſtupendious Judgment! I ſee it is eaſie for God to do ſuch things as are hardly poſſible for men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, till they ſee them done. So true is it, that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60264:175"/>the wayes of God are above our wayes, and his thoughts above our thoughts, as much as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veris are above the Harth. How good is it then to be armed againſt all ſorts of evil, not only ſuch as are likely and probable, but even thoſe which are no more than poſſible? and, What evil is there which he cannot inſlict, to whom all things are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? For ought I ſee, no man is ſecured againſt any kind of Judgment, but he, that is ſecured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all (in ſome ſenſe,) by vertue of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Prov. 12.21. <hi>Wo evil ſhall happen to the juſt:</hi> with others of the ſame import.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60264:176"/>Upon this occaſion, I cannot but think of three other ſorts of houſes (as we may term them) which men have or may ſeek for and not be able to find.

How many ſuch houſes as thoſe could not be found, if they ſhould never ſo carefully be ſought for? How ordinarily are the dead tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of poſſeſſion, and the living come in their room? that is; Charnel-houſes have been turned into dwelling-houſes, and many more ſuch inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are like to be: ſo that it hath and will become impoſſible; not only to know the bodies of dead men again, but their very graves. And the then Earth it's ſelf, that is as it were the houſe of all graves, the great <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or <hi>place of skulls:</hi> Now when that time ſhall come which is ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. in which <hi>the earth and all the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up,</hi> that great Houſe of houſes and graves, if it be ſought for, will be found no more.</p>

                     <p>HOw great and particular a reſpect did the Fire ſhew to the Eſſigies of that worthy Knight,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60264:176"/>the honourable Founder of that which was the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> and doner of <hi>Greſham-Colledge,</hi> (which, for preſent, ſucceeds in the room of it;) I ſay, how great a reſpect, by the appointment of Divine Providence, (without which not a hair falleth from our heads) did that Fire ſhew to his Effigies in particular, which it left ſtanding and undefaced, whilſt mean time the Statues of all the Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> ſince the Conqueſt, were demoliſhed and thrown down by it. No man could have anſwered it, to have put more honour upon a fellow-Subject, than upon his lawful Prince, much leſſe upon one Subject than upon many that had ſwayed the Scepter within his native Soil (for certainly there is an honour which Kings, as Kings, may challenge from their own people, greater than is due to any of their Subjects): but God, who is the King of Kings, may do what he pleaſe, He may <hi>pull down the mighty from their ſeats, and exalt them of low degree,</hi> as it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.52. Men muſt have regard to political claimes and rights, in diſpenſing their reſpects, and give honour to whom honour is due upon that account: but moral conſiderations are thoſe which the Great God takes notice of, who is otherwiſe <hi>no reſpecter of perſons,</hi> yet hath promiſed to <hi>honour thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour him,</hi> and is alwayes obſervant, though not of mens ſecular dignities, yet of their real worth and deſerts.

They were, as I may ſay, the God-fathers to that Noble Structure, which put their own names upon it; but he the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which gave Being to it.

Yet this muſt be acknowledged, though he made it an Edifice, yet they made it an <hi>Exchange,</hi> by their Royal Sanction and deſignation: but, to do the former, <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus erat.</hi> And is all that coſt and labour loſt, which that generous Knight did beſtow upon that noble Foundation? Surely no; For, beſides the great ſervice which that well-intended Structure did to the Nation for a hundred years together, ſuch, and ſo great was the fragrancy of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ointment, which by him was poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of <hi>London</hi> and of it's Inhabitants, that the favour thereof will never be out of their noſtrils; nor ſhall they need the help of a ſtanding <hi>Exchange,</hi> to remember ſo worthy a Founder by. Three ſignal marks of honour did the late deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fire (or rather God, who is ſaid to divide the flames of fire (which may be meant of diſtributing them as he pleaſeth) put upon that renowned Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. One was that I have been writing of, <hi>viz.</hi> the forbearance of his Effigies, and of his alone (as if the relation of a Founder and nobile Benefactor, had put a peculiar ſacredneſs into it.) You might have ſeen him (his Statue I mean) after the Fire ſafe and ſound, as <hi>Noah</hi> was after the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60264:177"/>flood, the one having eſcaped a Deluge of Fire (if I may ſo call it) as the other did a deluge of Water: <hi>Noah</hi> was preſerved by the viſible and probable means of an Ark, in which himſelf and his family were imbarqued; but, all the Ark, or means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation which this worthy Knight had, was only the immediate Providence of God, which ſeemed to intend a particular reſpect, for and towards ſo great a Benefactor; reſerving him, as we hope, (in Effigie I mean,) to ſee another Exchange, as <hi>Noah</hi> was, (but he indeed in Perſon,) to ſee another World, after the deſtruction of the firſt; whom for that reaſon the ancient <hi>Poets</hi> are ſuppoſed to have meant by him, they call <hi>Janus,</hi> with two Faces, for that he had faced two Worlds. Another badg of Honour put upon him was, the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that other Famous-Building, known by the name of <hi>Greſham-Colledge,</hi> which that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knight had long ſince given to a Publick-Uſe; intimating, that he wiſht no better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors than the <hi>Muſes</hi> in that Houſe, in which himſelf did ſometimes dwell. A third Honour which befel him at this time was, that his own Dwelling-Houſe (that was) ſhould, for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and till the former can be built again, be made the Royall Exchange, as if no man could provide an Exchange fit to receive our Merchants, but their old Founder Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham:</hi> which thing is no ſmall acceſsion of dignity, to that place, which as a Colledge furniſhed with able Profeſſors, and good Lectures, well indowed, was very Honourable before. Thus was the worthy Knight thrice dubbed (if I may ſo call it) after the firſt time, and that by the fire. Where then is the man that hath an eſtate commenſurate with ſo great an undertakine,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60264:178"/>that when he conſiders theſe things would not be ambitious, to do as Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> had done before him; I mean to build an Exchange in Lieu of that which now lieth in aſhes? What better way could he think of, whereby to perpetuate his name to all Poſterity? or wherein could he better ſerve his Native-Countrey? Is there never a rich Batchelor devoted to a ſingle life? Nor yet any Childleſs (and almoſt kindred-leſs) Widower that hath Gold and Silver enough to compaſs ſuch a glorious work as that? thereby he may acquire to himſelf a name, and a memorial in the world bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that of ſons and daughters. How oft do great eſtates (even ſufficient for ſo great an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize as I am ſpeaking of) fall into the hands of men that neither know how to uſe them whilſt they live, nor yet how to diſpoſe them when they die, either for their own honour, or for a publick good. Is it not eaſier to find ten men with ſuch eſtates, as Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> had, than one man with ſo Noble and generous a Spirit? I wiſh ſome men do not bequeath their money to not much better purpoſes, than if they had purchaſed Coals with it to ſend to <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> or thrown it into the Sea, rather then imploy it to ſo good, and charitable a Uſe, as is rebuilding of the Royal Exchange. Brave ambition to leave a name juſtly renowned amongſt men, if it be any thing of a vice, is, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſo generous, and ſo like a virtue that ſome low-ſpirited men were never capable of it, nor can ever be made to feel the ſharpeſt Spurrs of Honour, ſo as thereby to be ſtimulated and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Heroical Enterprizes. I am amazed to think that ſome, but ordinary men, have parted with their very lives, only to tell the world they were no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60264:178"/>or to leave a Name for valour behind them (which would be but nine days wonder) when others of better birth, and quality will not part ſo much as with their eſtates to good uſes (no not when they come to die) whereby to inform the world for ever, that they were lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Countrey, as was ſaid of that Centurion; <hi>He hath loved our nation, and built in a Synagogue.</hi>

What Mettal is there that more reſembleth Fire than doth burniſhed-Braſs? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.7. we read, that the feet of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures there ſpoken of, did <hi>ſparkle like the colour of burniſhed-Braſs.</hi> It is but fit that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of things ſhould bear as lively a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance as may be, of thoſe things of which they are intended Memorials: So the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> made choice of Artificial <hi>Mice</hi> and <hi>Emerods,</hi> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60264:180"/>of thoſe that were true and natural: More over, if <hi>London</hi> were conſumed by Treachery, no mettal can be more fit to receive the Characters of their moſt Impudent Villany, who (as to that) had ſinned with a Brow of Braſs, and with a Whores Fore-head. Or, if Stone be choſen rather of the two, to make that Pillar of, be it a laſting Emblem of the Hardneſs of their hearts, (harder than the neither Milſtone,) that could burn ſuch a City, and ruin ſo many thouſand Families, both for the preſent, and for many years, if not Ages to come.</p>
                     <p>Where the Fire began, there, or as near as may be to that place, muſt the Pillar be erected, (if ever there be any ſuch.) If we commemorate the places where our Miſeries began, ſurely the cauſes whence they ſprang, (the meritorious cauſes, or ſins, are thoſe I now intend,) ſhould be thought of much more. If ſuch a Lane burnt <hi>London,</hi> Sin firſt burnt that Lane: <hi>Cauſa cauſa eſt cauſa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>; Affliction ſprings not out of the duſt;</hi> not but that it may ſpring thence immeditely, (as if the duſt of the Earth ſhould be turned into Lice,) but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and originally it ſprings up elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>As for the Inſcription that ought to be upon that Pillar, (whether of Braſs or Stone,) I muſt leave it to their Piety and Prudence, to whom the Wiſdom of the Parliament hath left it: Only three things I both wiſh and hope concerning it; The firſt is, That it may be very humble, giving God the glory of his righteous Judgements, and taking to our ſelves the ſhame of our great demerits. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the Confeſſion which ſhall be there Ingraven, may be as impartial, as the judgement its ſelf was; not charging the guilt for which that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60264:181"/>fire came upon a few only, but acknowledging that all have ſinned, as all have been puniſhed. Far be it from any man to ſay, that his ſins did not help to burn <hi>London</hi> that cannot alſo ſay (and who that is know not) that neither he nor any of his either is, or are ever like to be, any thing the worſe for that dreadful fire. Laſtly, whereas ſome of the ſame Religion with thoſe that did hatch the Powder-plot, are, and have been vehemently ſuſpected to have been the Incendiaries, by whoſe means <hi>London</hi> was burned, I earneſtly deſire that if time, and further diſcovery, be able to acquit them from any ſuch guilt that Pillar may record their Innocency and may make themſelves, <hi>as an Iron Pillar or Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Wall,</hi> (as I may allude to <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.18.) againſt all the accuſations of thoſe that ſuſpect them, but if indeed, and in truth that Fire either came, or was carried on and continued by their treachery that the Inſcription of the Pillar may conſigne over their names to perpetual hatred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy.</p>
                     <p>Though I have thought too long already upon this ſubject; yet, me-thinks, I cannot but muſe yet a little further, How men will or ought to be affected with ſeeing that Pillar, and reading ſuch an Inſcription, as, I preſume will be made upon it. Will they not reflect and ſay, Alas! Is the greateſt part of a famous City come to this? (or rather was it brought to this?) What nothing but a brazen Pillar in lieu of the major part of a renowned City? Doleful exchange; As the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel we read of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.6. told the Women that came to Chriſts Sepulchre, <hi>He is not here, for he is riſen.</hi> So this Pillar ſtands but to tell men, that a glorious City, that ſometimes ſtood
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60264:181"/>hereabouts, is not here now; for it (or moſt of it) is burnt and gone.</p>
                     <p>How uncomfortable is this in compariſon of the two Pillars we read of, <hi>viz.</hi> a Pillar of Cloud, and a Pillar of Fire, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.14. Thoſe were Pillars for direction, but this was in token of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. In thoſe God went before his people, by day and by night, but in the Fire, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned this Pillar, he came againſt us. Then was God to his people as a Shadow from the heat of the rage of their enemies, as a Wall of fire for their protection, but this Pillar calls that time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, in which God covered himſelf, as with a cloud, that the prayers of <hi>Londoners</hi> ſhould not paſſe unto him, and came forth, not as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, but a conſuming fire, not for, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt poor <hi>London.</hi> Surely the place, where that Pillar ſhall ſtand, will be made a <hi>Bochim,</hi> for who will be able to paſſe by it, and not ſhed ſome tears? Yet as woful tidings as that Pillar is to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with, How do I long to ſee it once erected (which if I never do, God grant that others may) for ſurely, that will never be done, till men can ſay of <hi>London,</hi> as the Prodigals Father of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Son.

                     <p>How ſuitable it is that a Faſt ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed upon ſuch an occaſion as this were eaſie to make appear.

The moſt obvious Reaſons ſeem to reſult from the Love we owe to God, the Relation in which we ſtand to our Anceſtors and Forefathers, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is due to the Judgements of God, and the bad influence which the ſins of our Anceſtors and Predeceſſors may have upon ourſelves in caſe we lay them not to heart. We are ſorry that thoſe whom we dearly love have been injured by others (and not then only when we have injured them ourſelves); yea, if we hear of any great wrong that was done them many years ago, we are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it, and affected with it (though poſſibly not ſo much as if it were but yeſterday). And will not true love to God cauſe us in like manner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the known injuries that have been done to him? (and ſuch are all the great violations of his Law) yea, though by others, and many years ſince. If thoſe that have wronged the perſons we love, were ſuch as were nearly related to ourſelves (as when <hi>Saul,</hi> that was <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Father, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unkind to <hi>David,</hi> whom himſelf had a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for) it troubleth us ſo much the more. So would love to God cauſe us to do, when thoſe from whoſe Loins we ſprang (or who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60264:183"/>near to us), have greatly provok'd him, to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>om all by paſt things (though even worn out of the memory of men) are alwayes as preſent. By this Rule, though ſucceſsors ought to mourn over the ſins of their predeceſsors, yet Children more eſpecially over the ſins of their Parents, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parents, and other Relations one of another. We reverence not the Judgements of God as we ought, if hearing what God hath done to others for the ſame ſins whereof ourſelves are guilty (more or leſs) we do not both mourn, and tremble, and humble ourſelves before the Lord, leſt he ſhould do as much to us, as God ſaith to the Iſraelites, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.12, 14. <hi>Go and ſee what I did to</hi> Shiloh, <hi>I will do unto this houſe as I did to</hi> Siloh.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch conſiderations as theſe affect us not with the Sins and Judgements, which have gone over the heads of our Anceſtors in former times, then do we ourſelves become partakers of their ſins, and their ſins help to fill up the meaſure of ours: at we read <hi>of the ſins of the Amorites not being yet full</hi> (implying, that the ſins of the time preſent and time paſt, were thrown as it were into one meaſure); and as Chriſt ſpake to the perſecuting Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.35. ſaying, <hi>That upon them might come all the righteous blood, from the blood of</hi> Abel <hi>to the blood of</hi> Zacharias. We read of God's <hi>viſiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation;</hi> and that he doth when they make them theirs, as by other means, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by not mourning over them.</p>
                     <p>But if after-ages will not weep over the miſeries of this (which Hiſtory will not ſuffer them to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of), let them weep over their own loſses by this Fire: for I doubt not, but ſome may ſmart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60264:184"/>the conſequences of it hundreds of years hence: foraſmuch as ſome Eſtates were conſumed by it, which might otherwiſe have been tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Generation to Generation throughout ſeveral Ages to come. For ought I know, the fourth and fifth Generation from hence (to ſpeak within bounds) may have juſt cauſe, even from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence this Judgment may have upon themſelves, to obſerve the ſecond of <hi>September</hi> as a ſolemne Faſt.</p>
                     <p>As for the good ends we may propound to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in obſerving that day as a Religious Faſt, they are ſo plain and viſible as that nothing can be more. Solemnly to humble ourſelves time after time, under this mighty hand of God, that may be one. To beg that God would build up the waſte pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his good time, that may be another: as alſo, that he would make a gracious proviſion for his impoveriſhed Servants: And laſtly, To deprecate the like Judgement for time to come; ſeveral of which ends, if I miſtake not, are hinted to us in the Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>But when I further conſider it, how ghaſtly are the thoughts of another Faſt? and that for Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary perpetuity? Alas! how do Faſts multiply upon us? and the cauſes of them much more? —Sixty five gave us juſt occaſion for one perpetual Faſt, with reference to the dreadful Plague that was in that year, and — ſixty ſix by a no leſſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fire, hath given us another. Thus ſin upon ſin, hath made work for Faſt after Faſt. And the truth is, ſo many and ſo great are our ſins at this day, that if God ſhould puniſh each of them with a particular and proportionable Judgement, and every ſuch Judgement ſhould be commemorated
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60264:184"/>with an Anniverſary Faſt, the whole year might conſiſt of little elſe but Faſting-dayes: at leaſtwiſe all our Feſtivals be juſtled out, and all thoſe Letters be cloathed with Mourning, that were wont to be clad, (as it were) in Scarlet. Admit that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſhould be built again, and ſwell to as great a bigneſs as it did before (the latter of which no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon now living is like to ſee) yet even then there wil be found juſt cauſe of Faſting, Mourning, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, for the burning of <hi>London</hi> in 1666. the prints and footſteps whereof will even then be viſible, though not by an outward deſolation, yet by an inward and leſs perceptible decay. Though <hi>London</hi> may in proceſs of time, come to look as well in the face as ever it did; yet it's inwards and vital parts will go nigh to remain greatly waſted and conſumed.</p>
                     <p>But after I have inſiſted ſo long upon the Suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, Congruity, and Reaſonableneſs of a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faſt in Relation to the Fire: It is ſit I declare my ſelf as to the nature and manner of the Faſt I wiſh for, and which only will ſtead us, <hi>viz.</hi> Such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But, my work is, to treat of thoſe places that did not eſcape, and now particularly of <hi>Zion</hi>-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The place where that Colledge ſtood, from the firſt time that I can receive any account of it, was alwayes a ſeat of Charity; firſt in the Oare (as I may call it) and afterwards refined. By Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Ore, I mean, that which was popiſh and ſuperſtitions: For the firſt Foundation that I read of in that place was a Nunnery: After that, it was converted to an Hoſpital, in the year, 1332. for the relief of one hundred blind men, and was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Priory or Hoſpital of Saint <hi>Mary</hi> the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, founded by <hi>William Elſing,</hi> the which <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> became the firſt Prior there.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60264:185"/>where that Priory was ſituated, was ſince erected the Colledge I am ſpeaking of, for the Clergy of <hi>London</hi> and Liberties thereof, and for the ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of twenty poor people, ten men and ten wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>An exemplary and well-contrived piece of Bounty and Charity was the founding of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the Alms-houſes thereunto belonging: Which I muſt needs ſpeak in praiſe of thoſe it's worthy Founders, whoſe Names ſhould alwayes live, though their Works be now demoliſhed.</p>

                     <p>And, as their Charity was liberal, (which I may call intenſive;) ſo was it no leſſe extenſive.

                        </gap> and ſubjects of Religion. There was Charity ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to both Sexes, ſo much to one as to anothers whereas ſome Senſualliſts have no charity, but for that Sex which is not their own, (<hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like, who took care to ſave the females, though he gave charge to drown the males, as if they had been ſo many Mice:) And, certain Humoriſts on the other hand pretend to ſet their whole love upon their own Sex, profeſſing themſelves to be Miſogyniſts, or haters of Women; which, whether in pretence or in reality, is another ſinful extreme. Again, That Colledge was kind and Charitable, both to the Learned and Unlearned; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>he was a Doctor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wiſe and to the fooliſh:</hi> Whereas ſome, meer Schollars themſelves, have no love for any but Learned men: and, others again have a kind of Antipathy to Schollars, as ſuch. Laſtly, The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiveneſs
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60264:186"/>of the Charity that gave that Colledge appeareth, in that it was a benefit both to Rich and Poor, (for, as to ſome things, thoſe that are Rich may need help, as truly as thoſe that are poor:) Thither might Perſons of Quality, whoſe Libraries and uſual Divellings were in the Country, repair, and be furniſhed with thoſe Books they could not meet with elſewhere.</p>

                        </gap>ated, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Do good to all men:</hi> And, one great fault of this Age, is, That the Charity of men, (like their reſpects,) is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſome, only to <hi>Pauls</hi> in others, to <hi>Cephas;</hi> in others, to <hi>Apollos,</hi> (as I may allude:) but, the World will never be right, till men have learnt to love all good People as ſuch.</p>
                     <p>On Mr. <hi>Simpſons</hi> part, who founded the Library, it was, as ſome call it, a Living-Charity; for, he built it in his life-time, at his own proper coſt and charges: whereas ſome others have, in effect, ſaid, That their Mony ſhould go to good uſes, when they had nothing elſe to do with it: then,) and not till then;) yea, poſſibly repented of that too, ere they died. I have moreover called it an hurable-Charity, (a <hi>Charity that did not vaunt it ſelf;</hi>) becauſe the aforeſaid Founder of the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did not ſcorn to build upon another mans Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or to ſpend himſelf in adding to another mans Work; (who it was to be expected) would bear the name of the Principal Founder. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he that can ſeek the good of others, and not ſeek his own honour at the ſame time; that, ſo others be benefited, doth not much care though himſelf be over—lookt.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I ſaid, It was a handſome, and a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piece of Charity, and ſo it was: For, How no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60264:187"/>a Treatment did the Founder provide quarterly for thoſe Miniſters ſucceſſively, for whoſe ſake chiefly, or for whoſe uſe, he built that Noble Colledge. Foraſmuch as he was pleaſed to give forty Pounds yearly for four Dinners for the Clergy, who were to Dine together in that Colledge, after they had broke their Faſt with a good <hi>Latin</hi> Sermon.</p>
                     <p>A ſcornfull Charity is (as our Proverb phraſeth it) but a bit and a knock; ſuch, as all ingenuous perſons, that can ſpare it, had as lief go without: but Charity, confer'd with reſpect, is like a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond well-ſet, or a Picture placed in ſuch a light, as ſheweth it to the beſt advantage: It is good milk, well ſweetned; whereas others, like our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb of the red-Cow, <hi>Give good milk, and kick down part of it</hi> again. All theſe things put together, methinks the Founders of that Colledg and Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, were noble Patterns of Charity; and therefore pitty it is, that their Colledge and their Names ſhould lie in aſhes together: that the latter ſhould not remain as famous as ever, though the former be taken away. The reſpect which Schollars owe to the memory of <hi>Sion-Colledge,</hi> for the kindneſs intended to them in it, as alſo for the good which many have received from it, (where ſome I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, got more Learning out of thoſe publick Books, than others did out of thoſe that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and peculiarly their own; Some throve upon the Common, better than others did upon their own rich Incloſures; ſome got more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for nothing, than others did out of coſtly Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries of their own purchaſing: would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſay leſs of it than I have ſaid; neither will I ſay much more concerning it.</p>
                     <p>Only one thing I muſt not fail to Obſerve, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Providence of God was pleaſed to watch
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60264:187"/>over the greateſt part of the Library belonging to that Colledge, and to ſave it from the Fire. At firſt, there was a Colledge without a Library, and afterwards a Library-Houſe for ſome time without Books; Now, (thanks be to God,) there are Books good ſtore, but neither Colledge nor Library to place them in: But, Shall it be alwayes ſo? Are there no more <hi>VVhites</hi> and <hi>Simpſons</hi> to build ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sion</hi>-Colledge, with a Library to it, in the room of that which is burnt down? Methinks the very name of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhould invite ſome good man, one, or more, to ſuch a Work as that, having where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to accompliſh it; or, if it were but in part, to contribute towards it: Doth the preſent Age afford no man equal in Eſtate and Charity to the two former Founders of that Colledge? whereof one was but a Parſon, the other but a Vicar. One would think there were a great many Perſons that have double and treble, yea ten-fold that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Revenue, that ever they had: But, if no body will do it, (as far be it from me, to think, the World is grown ſo bad, as bad as it is,) I ſhall be prone to think, that the generation that now is hath abandoned all care of Learning, Religion, and Charity, or of any thing elſe but what men ſhould not care for.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60264:189"/>ſtood, I ſay, ſo ſecurely, under the wing of Divine Providence, as if they had been ſo many Iron Pillars or Walls of Braſs.</p>
                     <p>It calls to mind that paſſage, where the Prophet ſpeaking of God, ſaith, <hi>That he giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might, he increaſeth ſtrength, Iſa.</hi> 40.29. To be ſure, thoſe houſes had no might or ſtrength of their own againſt ſuch a Fire; had it ſeized them, it would have made but a blaze of them, it would have ſwallowed them up quick, unleſs the great God had interpoſed, as he did on behalf of the three Children in the fiery Furnace. The preſervation of thoſe houſes, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon, not as if it were a Miracle, but as a very great wonder and demonſtration of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Mira &amp; Miracula,</hi> that is, <hi>Wonders and Miracles,</hi> are uſually diſtinguiſhed. Miracles put Nature out of its courſe; as when the Sun was made to ſtand ſtill, the Red-ſea dried up, &amp;c. but I cannot ſay, that in this caſe any ſuch thing was done. Poſſibly, the wind ſay ſtill, or blew ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, at what time the Fire came near thoſe houſes: but, Who was it that called the wind into his treaſurie again, at that very time, or elſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to blow from another Coaſt? Was it not that Great God, who is ſaid, to ride upon the wings of the wind, and to make the Clouds his Chariots? and for that end (as may be meet for us to conceive) that he might convince the world, that all Safety and Danger is as he pleaſeth to make it, that he can expoſe thoſe things which ſeem to be moſt ſecure, and ſecure thoſe things which are moſt expoſed: Of this we have many Inſtances. In the time of the laſt great Plague, how many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were there infected with it, yea, and died of it, who, to all appearance, were out of harms way?
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60264:190"/>whereas others again, who lived as it were in the mouth of danger, and jaws of death (as namely in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected families, yea, ſome in Peſt-houſes) were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and are alive to this very day.</p>
                     <p>When the Arrows of God ſlew about, ſome ſtood (not knowing how to help it) as it were at the very mark, and yet it was the pleaſure of him that had the bow in his hand not to ſhoot them; others ſtood either wide of the Butt, or far beyond it, and yet a Dart ſtruck thorow their Liver: an invenomed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row took hold of them, and drunk up their Spirits. So it fals out in Spiritual things. How great was <hi>Lot</hi>'s danger in <hi>Sodom?</hi> (the very air of which place ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be infectious, as to matter of filthineſs) yet there he continued chaſte, how ſafe would one have thought him upon the Mountains (as for any ſuch matter); yet God leaving him there, he became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous with his own Daughters. The Almighty ſeemeth to take pleaſure, yea, and to glory in doing unlikely things. The Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.3. aſcribeth to <hi>God terrible things, ſuch as men looked not for.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the iſſues of life and death in his hands, he ſo ordereth it many times for his own glory, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons notoriouſly weak and crazy ſhould hold out a long ſiege of diſtempers, yea, and overcome them at laſt (after ſeveral years of drooping) whereas others of <hi>Sampſon</hi>-like ſtrength (in compariſon of them) fall ſick, and die within a few days; So, weak Chriſtians (both as to grace and gifts) are many times kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted of the preſent world, and enabled to quench all the fiery darts of Sathan, whilſt ſome that excell them, both in gifts and graces, are ſometime left of God (in order to their greater humbling) to take ſhamefull falls, and for a time to be overcome of the evil one: witneſs <hi>David</hi> and others. So the ſoft Scabbard (much more in danger as one would think)
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60264:190"/>oft-times receiveth no hurt by lightning, whilſt the ſame lightning, paſſing thorough it, doth melt the Stee within. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerved by himſelf, that when he was weak, then he was ſtrong, meaning ſtronger or more ſtrengthned by God, than at other times: which words imply, that when he was ſtrongeſt to his own thinking, then was he really weaker than at other times, becauſe then he had leſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with him.

                     <p>
                        <hi>LOndons</hi> downfall may Alarm all the World. As many bad People as were in it, let him, that can, point out that City in which there are more (ſo far as men can judg) that are truly good. If ten righteous perſons, yea, if fifty, yea, if ten times fifty, (to ſpeak within compaſs,) could have ſaved it, <hi>London</hi> had not been deſtroyed: There were more than a few Names within that <hi>Sardis,</hi> of ſuch as had not defiled their garments like others; Yet, it ſhould ſeem, not enow to weigh againſt the ſins of the reſt. Comparing <hi>London</hi> with other places, we may call it a Green-Tree; and, <hi>If this were done to the green Tree, What ſhall be done to the dry? If Judgement begin at the Houſe of God, where ſhall the wicked and ungodly appear?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I doubt not but there were ſins enow in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to deſerve the Judgment that did befall it, yea, and a greater than that; but, by the ſame reaſon, there is guilt enough in all other places to expoſe them to as great a deſolation. <hi>Job</hi> had ſins enow of his own to acquit God, in ſtripping him of all his earthly Comforts, and ſetting him upon a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill to <hi>ſcrape his ſores with poſtheards;</hi> yet <hi>Job</hi> had not, at that time, his fellow <hi>in all the Eaſt-Countrey, for a man ſearing God, and eſchewing evil:</hi> ſo that God might as juſtly have done the ſame thing to any
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60264:191"/>man of that age, as to him. Sins, comparatively ſmall, have ſometimes been branded with great Puniſhments; witneſs, <hi>Davids numbering the People,</hi> and <hi>the Bethſhemites looking into the Ark;</hi> poſſibly to ſhow, that little ſins are commenſurate with great Judgements, in point of evill, as a grain of ſome Poiſons may be as hurtful as a dram of others; ſo leſſer ſinners do ſometimes fall under heavy Judgements, to ſhow, that even they deſerve ſuch Scorpions as thoſe, and others, greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but that the patience of God extends to the reprieving of them for the preſent; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abiathar, Thou art worthy to dye; but I will not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Such as charge thoſe ſins upon <hi>London,</hi> which it was never guilty of, might have had more colour for ſo doing, if the Judgement had not fallen upon all ſorts of men, as well thoſe whom they think free from any ſuch guilt, as others, who were really free though they do not think them ſo.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeak of <hi>London,</hi> as worſe than indeed it was, (that is, as worſe than other places;) is no other, than to beſpeak ſecurity in other places, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that warning which they ought to take, and which is indeed given them by the deſtruction of <hi>London.</hi> Who hath not reaſon to think, that other places ſhall likewiſe periſh, if they repent not? All my doubt concerning <hi>London,</hi> is, whether it were better than moſt other places proportionably to the mercies and means of grace, which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed above them; or whether, thoſe things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, its ſins did not preponderate: but whether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely conſidered, it did not more abound with people, of good and unblamable lives, then moſt other places do, I do not much queſtion, nor can I tell who doth.</p>

Which nevertheleſs he was made to drink, unleſs his being ſtrengthened to undergoe it, as the next verſe tells us, that then there appeared an Angel, from heaven ſtrengthening him: as alſo his being inabled to triumph over principallities upon the Croſs? (as is ſaid <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15.) might be interpreted an eminent Deliverance vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed him in and upon the Croſs. I am miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. doth not give thanks to God thorough Jeſus Chriſt for delivering him as to the body of Death, which yet he carryed about with him, and therefore was not delivered from but under it, as the foregoing words do ſhew, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of Death? And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. the Apoſtle ſaith, God is faithful who will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape (or to be delivered) that ye may be able to beat it; ſeeming thereby to inſinuate that Deliverance and Temptation may ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and do ſo, when a man is not tempted above what he is able, but together with the temptation, hath aſſiſtance to bear it. Were not the Iſraelites delivered in the red Sea, <hi>Jonas</hi> in the great deep and Whales belly? <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions den? the three children in the fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, I ſay were they not firſt truly delivered in each of theſe, as afterwards from and out of them? To be kept under water from drowning and in the midſt of fire, from being burnt, is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance with a witneſs. Had the buſh that did burn and was not conſumed been preſently quencht, or ſnatcht out of the fire, it had not been ſo eminently delivered as it was. Deliverances
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60264:196"/>under great troubles though leaſt obſerved by many, are of all others moſt oblervable and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall: what more admirable promiſe than that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt thorough the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, they ſhall not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt thorough the fire, thou halt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> No place can be more pertinent than that is, to prove there is ſuch a thing as Deliverance under trouble: the notion is worth our purſuing, becauſe it is full of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; it opens as it were a new ſpring of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to thoſe that are under trouble which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did overlook before, as <hi>Hagar</hi> did thoſe wells of water which were neareſt to her. Many people have no more joy and comfort than they have hopes of having their loſſes repaired in kind, and their temporal troubles removed, and God knows whether that may ever be, when they themſelves deſpair of it, their hearts faile within them, he that thinks himſelf utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and that it will not be worth while for him to live, if <hi>London</hi> be not ſuddenly rebuilt, trading ſpeedily reſtored, when theſe things appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, will be at his wits ends, but he that knows and believes that God (who is onely wiſe) can make him and his happy, though <hi>London</hi> ſhould ſtill lye in aſhes, and trade not revive in many years to come; that God can work a Deliverance for him in and under all publick calamities, and in deſpight of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them, he I ſay will in patience poſſeſſe his ſoul. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. are much to be heeded, where he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed be God who comforteth us in all our Tribulations;</hi> he doth not ſay who delivereth us out of all, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60264:197"/>who comforteth us in all our Tribulations, and what is that but a Deliverance under trouble, when God doth comfort us in it? If there be ſuch a thing as Deliverance under trouble, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may and will rejoyce in the hopes of that, who are paſt all hope (though I think that ſhould not be neither) of ever ſeeing an end of their preſent troubles. They look upon Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of the preſent calamities to be at ſo great a diſtance, that they think the ſteed will ſtarve whilſt the graſs grows, and their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes will fall in the wilderneſs, ere the time come for entring into <hi>Canaan.</hi> But now by virtue of the notion I am ſpeaking of, though I ſhould grant men of miſgiving minds, there are as great unlikelyhoods as they can ſuppoſe, that they ſhould ever re-enjoy, ſuch houſes trades, eſtates, conveniencies, as formerly, or any thing comparable thereunto, yet may they live in a dayly expectation of a comfortable Deliverance, with and under thoſe calamities, which are like to continue upon them; that God together with their temptations, will make a way for their eſcape, men ſo perſwaded will be able to ſay with <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> though the fig-tree bloſſome not, and the labour of the <hi>Olive</hi> faile, yet will (or may they) rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of their Salvation. When <hi>Paul</hi> praved that the Meſſenger of <hi>Sathan,</hi> which buffetted him might depart, God gave him no aſſurance of that, at leaſt-wiſe for the preſent, but yet told him that which ſatisfied him, though that evil meſſenger were likely to continue, namely, that his Grace ſhould be ſufficient for him. The Iſraelites knew that their captivity
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60264:197"/>in <hi>Babylon</hi> would certainly laſt ſeventy years. Therefore it was not thehopes of a ſpeedy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from thence, that did bear up the hearts of believers amongſt them, but the hopes they had, that God would be good to them, in and under their captivity, and ſhow them mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in a ſtrange land. If the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> knew, as it is like they did, that they muſt wander no leſſe than ſorry years in the wilderneſs, ere they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was the Mercy and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which they did expect in the wilderneſs, not out of it, during all that time, that did ſupport them; as hoping that in that howling deſert, God would be no wilderneſs or Land of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them. If God ſpread a table for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the wilderneſs, if he give them water out of the Rock, and Manna from heaven, are not thoſe things to be reckoned Deliverances (namely from the evils that in ſuch a place, they might expect) though Quailes ſhould be with-held? Though the famine were not removed, yet ſeeing <hi>Elijah</hi> was ſed the mean time, though but by <hi>Ravens,</hi> it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that he was delivered in and under famine. If to the righteous there ariſe light in darkneſs, as is promiſe there ſhall, is not that Deliverance? Though <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were in priſon, and their feet in the ſtocks, yet if they were ſo chearful there, as to ſing praiſes to God at midnight, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. was not that a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He is delivered from death, as to whom the ſting of death is taken away, and he from the noiſome peſtilence who is ſecured, that the evill of it ſhall not come nigh him (which is all that ſeems intended by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>Pſal</hi> 91.3. verſe, compared with the tenth) <hi>David</hi> ſomewhere prayes that God would bring his Soul out of trouble, and his Soul out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Soul of a man is the man, if that be brought out of trouble, in whole, or in part, though his body, his name, eſtate, relations are yet introuble, the man himſelf is delivered. A man may be ſick and well at the ſame time (as <hi>Baul</hi> was poor, and yet rich at the ſame time) according to that of the Prophet, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants ſhall not ſay they are ſick, for their ſins ſhall be forgiven them; a man can be but well in Proſperity, and it may be as well with us, yea and better with us in adverſity, all things conſidered (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, it was good for him that he was afflicted) and in that caſe is not a man truly delivered even under affliction?

As proſpective-glaſſes do repreſent the object near at band, though it be ſome miles diſtant, ſo may this notion repreſent Deliverance at the very door, or as that which may come the next mornine, when ſorrow came but the evening before (<hi>viz.</hi> Deliverance in and under trouble, which may be ſufficient for us) though Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

                     <p>SUrely it is from a vain conceit, that the life of man conſiſts in his abundance, that thoſe who have not an abundance of earthly comforts, do ſo much covet after it; and thoſe that have, do ſo much bleſſe themſelves in it, as ſome are brought in ſaying, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, for I am rich;</hi> &amp; thoſe who have loſt of their ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ndance do mourn ſo inordinately, for the want of it. But whatſoever men think, Chriſt aſſures us it is not ſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. For there ſaith he, <hi>the life of a man conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> I think at preſent of ſix or or ſeven inſtances wherein that ſaying of Chriſt is verified. Firſt, The length or prolongation of mans life, doth not conſiſt in the abundance of what he poſſeſſeth. The oyle of riches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feed the lampe of life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. from the 6. to the 11. verſe. <hi>They that boaſt themſelves of their riches, none of them can redeem his brother, or give to God a ranſome for him, that he ſhould ſtill live for ever, and not ſee corruption, for he ſeeth that wiſe men dye, and leave their wealth to others.</hi> Look abroad and you will ſee more poor men that have lived to a great age than rich, (yea in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the humber, there is of one and of the other;) Some diſeaſes which poor people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſcape out of, and make but light of them, how often do they prove fatal and deadly to them that are rich? as if corruption were ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60264:199"/>to claime kindred of them, more than of others, and the hungry wormes to feed upon their well fed fleſh, rather than that of others: to allude to <hi>Job</hi> 17.14. <hi>I have ſaid to corruption, thou art my father, to the worme, thou art my mother, and my ſiſter:</hi> poor men lengthen their lives by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, &amp; rich men too too often ſhorten theirs by Luxury. Neither doth the end of mans life conſiſt in poſſeſſing an abundance; man was not ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, to load himſelf with thick clay, or to adde houſe to houſe, and land to land, as if he meant to dwell alone upon the earth, to poſſeſſe himſelfe of ſo many hundreds, or thouſands by the year, and ſo leave it to his poſterity. That theſe are trifles to the great end which man was ſent into the world for, appeareth by <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. where <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that God hath ſet man upon the face of the earth, to ſeek after God (there is the end of life) if nappily he might find him out. Nor in the third place, doth the Credit of a mans life conſiſt in the meere abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth; they that have nothing to commend them but their riches, though they are flattered by many, are truly bonoured but by a few, moſt men wil bow downe to thoſe idols of Silver and of God, as I may cal them (becauſe it is the faſhion ſo to doe) but when their backs are turned upon them, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay of them, as the Apoſtle concerning idols in the general, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. we know that an Idol is nothing in the world, we know ſuch a one for all his brave outſides, and the caps and knees that are given him to be a worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſon; and to ſignifie juſt nothing.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60264:200"/>He is like a rich tomb without, which is ſo ill furniſhed within, that it is not worth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Fourthly, Neither doth the uſefulneſſe of mans life, conſiſt in the abundance of what he poſſeſſeth. <hi>Solomon</hi> tels of a poor man that by his wiſdome delivered a City, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.15. That a rich man void of wiſdom, could not have done with all his wealth; ſome do more good in the world with a little, than others doe that have great eſtates. There are little figures in the world, and great Ciphers, great ones that ſpend all they can rap and rend together, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their luſts, and no body is the better for it; and others of meane condition, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſpend, and to be ſpent for publick good. Some great trees do but ſhade and prevent the growth of other plants, and meane time beare no fruit themſelves. Fifthly, Neither doth the ſucceſſefulneſſe of mans life, and of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, thereof depend wholly upon the abundance of what he poſſeſſeth. Now many elder brothers that have had great eſtates left them by their Parents, great portions with their Wives, and have in a few years, by Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe, Gaming, Whoreing, one or all of theſe, reduced themſelves and their families to a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Bread, ſelling their birth right as it were, for a Meſſe of Pottage. And on the other hand, how many younger brothers that have been bound to honeſt trades, and had no more from their parents, than a competent ſtock to ſet up with, have with the bleſſing of God, upon their induſtry, arrived at great eſtates? How many have ſet up with ſmal ſtocks, (it may be with nothing elſe but a ſtock of Credit)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60264:200"/>and in a few years, become very rich? and on the other hand, how many have had great ſtocks to begin with, and have ſoon brought them to nothing? Sixthly, Neither doth the life of men in, and as to their children (in whom parents are ſaid to live) conſiſt in, or depend upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of what they poſſeſſe, or of what they have to give them; how many fathers have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven great portions with their children, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to match them highly, and in a few years (yea months ſometimes) have ſeen both their money and their children caſt away? Others againe have had little wherewith to prefer their children in marriage, and yet have ſeen them as well diſpoſed of, as if they could have given them thouſands. Neither are good and comfortable yokefellows, the onely things that men are not ſure always to purchaſe, for their children by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great eſtates with them, but many other things there are that parents wiſh to ſee in their children, as namely, Health, Strength, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from Deformity, Wiſdome, Grace, which things if they be wanting, cannot be bought for them with all the Gold that is in both the <hi>Indies,</hi> neither can parents comfortably live or injoy themſelves in their children, if all or moſt of thoſe things be wanting. Laſtly, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and comfort of mans life, (which I take to be that which Chriſt here chiefly intends by the life of man) doth certainly not conſiſt in the abundance of what he poſſeſſeth; it is one thing to poſſeſſe, and another thing to injoy, he may injoy more that poſſeſſeth leſſe. Hear <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 37.16. <hi>A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.</hi> Some
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60264:201"/>men have more comfort in a diſh of green herbs, than others can find in a ſtalled Oxe, <hi>Zoph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> ſpeaking of a wicked man, <hi>Job</hi> 20.22. ſaith, <hi>that in the fulneſſe of his ſufficiency, he ſhall be in ſtraits,</hi> and why may not good men in the midſt of their ſtraits, have a kind of ſufficiency? the Scripture telling us, that a good man is ſatisfied from himſelf. I doubt not but ſome, and thoſe the very ſame perſons, have had more contentment in, or injoyment of God, and of themſelves in a lower and poorer, than ever they had in a higher and more plentiful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath reconciled them to the literal interpretation of theſe words, <hi>James</hi> 1.10. <hi>Let the rich</hi> (which may be underſtood of him that was rich) <hi>rejoyce in that he is made low.</hi> Moſt men count it eaſier, when they are once down, to ſit low, than to ſit high. The body may be too full of blood to conſiſt with health, as well as too empty, though that blood be all good. There is a <hi>Plethora</hi> or <hi>Redundancy</hi> of good blood, as well as a <hi>Cacochymia</hi> or <hi>Superfluity</hi> of bad humours, which makes men leſſe chearful, than they would otherwiſe be; ſo that breathing a veine may give ſome reliefe againſt Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly. Wiſe Marriners having caſt away ſome of their lading in a tempeſt, do with more hearts-caſe and ſecurity inioy the reſt; ſo fareth it with ſome men, after conſiderable loſſes, they are better ſatisfied with a part, than they were before with the whole. I ſee then expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth abundantly confirme what Chriſt hath ſpoken, touching the life of man nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the abundance of that he poſſeſſeth. I muſt then take leave to think, thoſe men are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60264:201"/>ſick-brained that think, no man can be happy unleſſe he have ſo many hundreds, yea thouſands by the year. Let a man make me believe if he can, that no man can make a pleaſant meale under twenty or thirty diſhes, when I know a man may feed as delightfully upon two or three, yea it may be upon one. Perſwade us who can that no man can travel a few miles to his ful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without a Coach and ſix Horſes: or that a man cannot ſleepe ſweetly any where but upon a bed of down, hung with velvet cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, when we all know the contrary. I like our proverb well, Enough is as good as a feaſt; (yea ordinarily it is better) I doubt not but Diſcontent is as often clad in Silks and Sattins as in leather doublets and canvais breeches; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times eaſier feet goe in plainer ſhooes; give me rather high ſhooes ſuch as Plow-men wear, with ſound toes in them, than high great gouty toes, in velvet ſlippers; let me rather tread in the dirt, where I can ſtand faſt, than walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſmooth ice, where I ſhall alwaies be in fear of falling; if then abundance of earthly things can neither prolong my daies, nor give me the true end of life, nor help me to that good name which is indeed a precious ointment, nor aſſure me of ſucceſſe, nor make me to be more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nor make my children more happie than with the bleſſing of God they may be without it, nor finally afford me more comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in my life, than others have, who have no abundance, if God hath diminiſhed my abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, I have no reaſon to mourne as one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, or as <hi>Micah</hi> did, when his idol Gods were taken from him, as if he had been
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60264:202"/>quite undone. If God ſo pleaſe, I may in this impaired condition, be as happie, yea more than ever I was.

Affliction is a teaching thing, for we read of Chriſt himſelfe that he did learne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience by the things he ſuffered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8. As the Law is ſaid to be a School-maſter to bring us to Chriſt, ſo is miſery a School-maſter to bring us to happineſs, in caſe we give our ſelves to be taught by it. As parents will keep their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at ſchoole no longer when once they are fit for the Univerſitie, but ſend them thither; ſo will God tranſlate his people to the <hi>Academy</hi> of a more pleaſing condition, when they are dulie ripened and prepared for it by the ſchoole of adverſitie; witneſſe theſe words of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12.13. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60264:202"/>thou chaſteneſt O Lord, and teacheſt him out of thy Law, that thou mayeſt give him rest from the dayes of Adverſity.</hi> Affliction is Gods plow, with which he breaketh up the fallow ground of mens hearts, and when that is done, he is moſt ready to ſow the ſeedes of peace and comfort, as it is written, light is ſowne for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart. Now ſowing preſuppoſeth plowing, nor would the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doe the former <hi>viz.</hi> to plow, but that he intends the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> to caſt in his ſeed, and would thereby prepare for it. Now there are ſeveral Leſſons which God doth or would teach men by his ſpeaking rod in affliction, if men doe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> would hear the voice of that rod, and him that hath appointed it. Firſt, God by affliction would teach men to praie.

As <hi>Abſolom</hi> fetcht <hi>Joab</hi> to him by ſetting his corne on fire: in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they will ſeek me earlie, ſaith God; yea and it alſo quickens men in praier, Chriſt in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonie prayed yet more ferventlie. Chriſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up prayers with ſtrong crying and tears to him that was able to ſave him from death: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that the approach of death did help to quicken him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. It is a Proverb, <hi>he that cannot pray, ſend him to Sea,</hi> affliction is a dangerous Sea, and God ſends many men thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may learne how to pray.

                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtruck down to the earth, and terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a voice from heaven we quicklie hear of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Behold he prayeth! <hi>Acts</hi> 16.11. ſo he had wont to doe in former times, for that he was a Phariſee, but now he ſo prayed and to ſo good
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60264:203"/>purpoſe as he never did before. And is not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (ſuch as it may be) a good means to get on of affliction? is it not ſaid, call upon me in the day of affliction, and I will deliver thee? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.17.19. We read, <hi>Fools becauſe of their Tranſgreſſions are afflicted, then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, he ſaveth them out of their Distreſſes,</hi> alſo verſe 13. If our affliction do not cauſe us to reſtraine prayer from the Almighty (like him that ſaid, this evill is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait on him any longer?) our prayers will prevaile with God, to reſtraine affliction in his due time and manner. Secondly, Another Leſſon which affliction teacheth us (or rather God by it) is to walk humbly, and to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I am ſure is the ready way to be exalted, In <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. We read how God lead the Iſraelites 40. years in the wilderneſs to humble them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that a wilderneſs condition, tends to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men. Earthly good things are the fuel of prides and the refore pride of life is ſpoken of as if it were a third part of all the things that are in the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. <hi>All that is in the world is, the luſt of the fleſh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life,</hi> that is fuel to theſe; now when the fuel is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, it may be expected that the fire will ſlake. And will not humility make way for our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? Surely it will, witneſſe that promiſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41, 42. <hi>If then their uncircumciſed hearts be humbled, then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember the land.</hi> If God humble us, he wil doe us good in our latter end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. See the promiſe <hi>James</hi> 4.10. <hi>humble your ſelves in the fight of the Lord, and he ſhall lift you up.</hi> Doth not God by his Prophet tell us,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60264:203"/>
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>That he dwelleth with the humble, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, to revive them?</hi> Thus you ſee affliction doth as it were, prepare Antidotes to expell its ſelf; as ſome of our beſt Antidotes, for expulſion of poyſon, are taken from the bodies of poyſonous creatures; as Serpents, Vipers. And affliction ſanctified, works humility, and humility exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, works out affliction. Thirdly, A third Leſſon, which God by affliction, teacheth man is to be patient, and to ſubmit to his div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> will. And this alſo will be found an excellent means to remove affliction, and recover proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in due time. We read <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>How that Tribulation worketh patience, and patience experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and experience that hope which maketh not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed.</hi> Now that which produceth an unſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering hope, doth ſurely contribute to delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, both as it is a kind of cauſe, in which hope foreſeeth ſuch an iſſue as deliverance is, as alſo, for that hope is as it were deliverance anticipated, for we are ſaved by hope, ſaith the text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. But more plainly, <hi>James</hi> 5.11. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and have ſeen the end of the Lord.</hi> Job was patient, and God afterwards gave him double in lieu of what he had taken from him, it is good that a man ſhould quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.26. and verſe 25. <hi>The Lord is good to them that wait for him.</hi> God ſometimes hath all his end in afflicting, when he hath but made us humbly to ſtoop and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41. <hi>If then they ſhall accept the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their iniquity,</hi> that is, if they did patiently bear the indignation of the Lord, as having ſinned againſt him, and ſubmit to the rod, then God promiſeth that he would remember their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60264:204"/>land, &amp;c. it is Gods manner to withdraw af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, when he hath once accompliſhed the end for which he ſent them. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 10.12. God ſaith, that when he had performed his whole work upon Mount <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then would he puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> who was their oppreſſor. If then the deſign of God in afflicting, be only to make us ſubmit to his will (as ſometimes it is) when we have learnt to do that (like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> that was become willing to ſacrifice his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which was all God intended to put him to) then is deliverance in one kind or other not far off. God doth not intend to make ſome men always poor, and deſpicable, though they are ſo for the preſent, but yet the copy of his countenance towards them, is as if he meant they ſhould always be in adverſity, whereas all he ſtands upon, is to make them contented ſo to be, if ſuch be his will concerning them; and when they have quietly laid themſelves down at Gods feet, bound their <hi>Iſaac</hi> to the altar with a true intent to ſacrifice him to the good pleaſure of God, and ſtretch forth their hand to do it, then comes as it were a voice from heaven ſaying, let it alone, it is enough that thou haſt done already; Behold I will accept a <hi>Ram</hi> for a burnt offering, inſtead of thy ſon, as God dealt with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.13. God doth many things but to try us and make us believe he will take all from us (when he means onely to wean us from all) that he may ſay of us, as of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Now I know thou fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt God, for thou haſt not withheld thy Son, thy onely Son from me.</hi> To be content always, to be in trouble, if God will have it ſo, is the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60264:204"/>way to come out, is one good way to eſcape. Fourthly, Affliction teacheth us to live under an awful ſenſe of God. It is a Schoole of fear as to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to God.) If God appear as a conſuming fire, one maine uſe we are to make of it is, to ſerve him with Godly fear; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. Now it is evident, that a due fear of God doth make way for Deliverance out of trouble: When God ſaw that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſo fearful to offend him, that he durſt not withhold his ſon <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> whom God had commanded him to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with his own hands, he gave him <hi>Iſaac</hi> again, and accepted a <hi>Ram</hi> in his ſtead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. When God had brought <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> to know that the Lord was God, that is, to fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence God as became him, and to humble himſelf before him, then ſaith the text, <hi>the Lord heard his ſupplication and brought him again to Jeruſalem, into his Kingdome,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.13. Fifthly, Affliction is a Schoole of obedience and circumſpect walking, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15, 16. <hi>See then that yee walk circumſpectly, becauſe the dayes are evil.</hi> Thoſe that walke in the dark take more than ordinary care leſt they ſtumble, and fall, new dayes of evill or affliction, are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dayes of darkneſſe. Proſperity hath hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more Temptations on one hand; than great affliction hath on the other hand: hence <hi>Agur</hi> deprecates poverty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Leſt I be poor and Steale, and take the name of the Lord in vaine.</hi> The Apoſtle was afraid leſt the inceſtuous <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian,</hi> if not timely comforted, might be ſwallowed up of two much ſorrow, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60264:205"/>and leſt <hi>Sathan</hi> ſhould get an advantage againſt him, verſe 11. affliction is a tempeſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt do like Pilots, who ſteer with greateſt circumſpection in a ſtorm, the hard froſt of adverſity, though it be apt to kill cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain weeds, as pride, ſecurity, and ſuch like? yet if care be not taken, it may alſo nip many hopefull bloſſomes (as unſeaſonable froſts uſe to do.) If ſuch eminent worthyes as <hi>Elijah, Job, Jonas, Jeremy,</hi> were between whiles worſe for thoſe afflictions, which ſhould have made them better, (as we know they were) we had need look to our ſelves, and walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at ſuch a time. Now that our ſo doing will make way for our deliverance. <hi>David</hi> tels us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. <hi>To him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the Salvation of God.</hi> And the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20. <hi>The Redeemer ſhall come to Zion, and unto them that turne from tranſgreſſions in Jacob.</hi> Sixthly, Another Leſſon which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction teacheth men, is to redeem time, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Redeeming the time becauſe the dayes are evill.</hi> Young Scholars are not more ordinarily whipt for any thing, than for loſing their time, and in order to making them ſpend their time bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We have never leſſe time to loſe than when the rod of the Almighty is upon our backs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction makes work whereſoever it comes (as Sickneſſe in a Family uſeth to do) and time is then moſt precious, when we have moſt work upon our hands, when we have moſt to do; yea it alſo indiſpoſeth for work, and when the iron is blunt, we had need put to the more ſtreng. Travellers make the beſt of their time in the depth of winter, and will hardly

When we look for the greateſt impediments, we had need take the moſt time before us, neither is the Redeeming of time more a duty in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, than a direct means to get out of it. Take one inſtance for all in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who being in priſon, were redeeming their mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night time from reſt and ſleepe, for ſinging and praiſing of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. And the next news we have of them is, they were both mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly ſet at liberty. Laſtly, Affliction is a Schoole of Faith and Affiance in God. <hi>David,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. At what time he was afraid he would put his truſt in God, and when he was overwhelmed, he would fly to the rock that was higher than he, meaning to God; and upon the wing of faith. And it is ſaid that ſhe who is a widdow indeed truſteth in God, and why ſhe that is a widdow, rather than ſhe who is a wife, but becauſe the condition of a widdow, is ordinarily more afflicted and diſconſolate: Moreover Afflictions are called the tryal of our Faith. All which paſſages prove that affliction is a Schoole of Faith as well as of patience. Now withall it is famouſly known, that the exerciſe of Faith, and dependance upon God, is a notable expedient for the removal of Affliction. What miracles of Deliverance are attributed to <hi>Faith, Heb.</hi> 11.33.

Our <hi>fathers truſted in thee, and thou didſt deliver them, they truſted in thee and were not confounded.</hi> Thus have I mentioned ſeven doors belonging to the valley of <hi>Acor</hi> (which ſignifies trouble) or ſo many wayes of eſcape out of Affliction, which are alſo dutyes in and under it. I ſee then in this caſe there are two gaps may be ſtopt with one hedge (a man may <hi>una fideliâ duos dealbare pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietes</hi>) there are two intentions may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one and the ſame medicine; two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions may be equally ſatisfied with one and the ſame anſwer; namely theſe two, how ought I to carry my ſelfe under Affliction? and what courſe ſhould I take to get out of Affliction? He that ſtudieth the latter onely, ſhall be able to do neither, he that minds the former well, ſhall doe both under one. He that conſiders onely how to get out of Affliction, troubles himſelfe with Gods work, and neglects his own, and neither can he himſelfe do what he aimes at, nor juſtly expect that God ſhould doe it for him. But he that makes it his onely buſineſſe to carry himſelfe under Affliction, as he ought; doth what he can, and intereſſeth God to do that which himſelf cannot doe, let us doe out part, and God will not faile to doe his, and ſo both will be done.</p>
                     <p>We need not trouble our ſelves, about getting into another form, let us but out-learn others that are in the ſame form (<hi>viz.</hi> of Affliction) with us, or at leaſt-wiſe keep pace with the beſt of them, and our maſter which is in heaven, will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60264:206"/>take care of our tranſlation into another forme, that is more to be deſired, when we ſhall be fit for it. I find God very angry with thoſe Jews that would think of nothing but comming out of captivity, ſo ſoon almoſt as they were gone into it, and would hearken to any lying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that would ſooth them up with ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtories; whereas their duty was to bring their ſpirits to be content with a captivity of ſeventy years long, to learne the law of ſuch a condition as that, and to comply with it, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.8. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Kingdom, which will not put their neck un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>that Nation will I puniſh with the Sword, and Famine, and Peſtilence, till I have conſum'd them by his hand.</hi> And verſe 17. <hi>Hearken not to them</hi> (namely <hi>who ſaid, that the veſſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cauſe us to fear thy great name, that when we pour out our cryes to thee, who canſt deliver from death, as Chriſt did in the dayes of his fleſh; we may be heard as he was, in that he feared.

Did <hi>Jacob</hi> indent with God for any more? <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. <hi>If God will give me bread to eat, and rayment to put on, then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi> Did <hi>Agur</hi> ask any more of God, (as for the things of this world,) when he ſaid, <hi>Feed me with food convenient?</hi> Yea, did he not deprecare that which was much more, when he ſaid <hi>Give me not riches, leſt, &amp;c.</hi> Dare we abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely pray for more than daily bread, (and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things as neceſſarie for life, whereof rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is one?) and ſhall we peremptorilie deſire more than we dare to pray for? Can thoſe deſires be regular; which we fear to make the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60264:208"/>matter of our prayers? Or, if God vouchſafe us as much as we think lawful and fit to pray for, why ſhould we not be content? Turn your deſires of greater things than theſe, into the form of a prayer, and hear how it will ſound: Lord give me riches, though <hi>Agur</hi> were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as to pray againſt them. Lord give me with <hi>Dives</hi> to be cloathed with Purple and fine Linnen, and to fare ſumptuouſlie every day; or to have wherewithall ſo to do. Lord give me ſo many hundreds by the Year, more than I need to ſpend. Lord give me one thouſand pound at leaſt; but rather two or three for every childe; I cannot be content with leſs as a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for each of them. Offer if you dare to put ſuch Incenſe as this into Chriſt his Golden Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for; Appear if you dare with ſuch requeſts as theſe at the Throne of grace; Expect if you can that as to ſuch requeſts Jeſus Chriſt ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for you. So abſurd prayers cannot be good deſires; nor can it be otherwiſe than abſurd to be diſcontented for the want of thoſe things which were abſurd to pray for. How many of our betters have barelie food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet are very thankful for what they have? The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had but bread and water, when for their murmuring they were deſtroyed of the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Beware of grumbling at Manna, and luſting after Quailes, leſt for ſo doing your carcaſſes fall in the Wilderneſs, as theirs did. If the end of life were to eat and drink, it were another matter; but if the end of eating and drinking be, that we may live, ſuch food as will keep us alive and in health, ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60264:208"/>with thankfulneſs: what a feaſt would a belly-full of bread be counted in a time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. How precious was an Aſſes head, yea a cab of Doves dung in the famine of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.28. Are we better than <hi>Lazarus</hi> who would have been glad of <hi>Dives</hi> his crums?</p>
                     <p>If that were a parable, then <hi>Lazarus</hi> is there put not for one perſon, but for every one, that is, ſuch as he is deſcribed to have been: namely defigned for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome, and yet glad of crums in this World. Let me here diet with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> (if the will of God be ſo) may I but be ſure hence-forth to lodge with him in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Do we make light of food and raiment for us and ours? alas, what more can this World afford us, though we have ever ſo much of it? <hi>Solomon</hi> complaining how the hearts of men are taken up with thoughts and cares of worldly things (which is conceived to be the meaning of that difflicult expreſſion, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 3.11. <hi>He hath ſet the World in their hearts,</hi>) ſhowes what the benefit of the World, and of the things therein is. <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoyce, and to do good in his life: And alſo that every man ſhould eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labours, v.</hi> 12, 13. I finde the rich man ſpoken of <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.19. diſtinguiſhed from the beggar only by this, that he are better meat, and wore better cloaths. For the Text ſaith, <hi>That he was cloathed in Punple, and fared ſumptuouſly every day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what great matter is it, that our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould have every thing of the beſt? What are our bodies, eſpecially if too much pamper'd: but as ſo many reeking dunghils, annoying our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60264:209"/>ſoules with ill ſteames and vapours? or like dead carcaſſes joyned to living men, (a torture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Mezintius</hi>) which are an unſufferable offence to them. As it is ſaid of <hi>Eve,</hi> that ſhe was firſt in the tranſgreſſion; and as ſhe drew in her husband, ſo our bodies many times, like ſo much tinder do receive the firſt ſparks of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation: or like the thatch of an houſe, are firſt kindled, and as that might ſet the whole houſe, ſo do they the whole ſoul on fire. Many ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the body, are occaſioned or fomented, or both, by the over-ſanguine, or melancholy, or cholerick temper or diſtemper thereof: which ſhewes we are no debtors to the fleſh, to fulfill the deſires thereof. Moreover if we conſider whence our bodies came, and whither they are going, it will appear there is no ſuch cauſe to be greatly concerned for them; that they ſhould wear the fineſt wool, and eat the ſineſt of the wheat. Duſt they were, and to duſt they ſhall teturn. Why muſt they needs be ſed ſo daintily which themſelves muſt ſhortly become food for wormes? when we feed our bodies too high, what do we but feed our luſts, yea, feed diſeaſes in our very bodies? ſo that it is become a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man digs his grave with his teeth. Few kill their bodies by mortifying them: but many by indulging them. <hi>Chriſtmat</hi> kills many more than <hi>Lent.</hi> As the Ape is ſaid to hug her young ones to death: ſo many kill their bodies with too much kindneſs to them. As over-pamper'd Horſes oft times throw their riders, and give them their deaths wound: ſo are men too commonly thrown both in oſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſin, and death it ſelf, by indulging their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60264:209"/>bodies over much. The body (as one ſaith well) ought to be kept, as not <hi>infra,</hi> ſo neither <hi>ſupra negotium; ſed per negotio;</hi> not too high for its work, but equal to it. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he did <hi>keep under his body, and brought it into ſubjection.</hi> So far was he from cockring of it till it became his maſter, as too many do. There is no ſmall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in over-exalting our blood and natural ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> was never more afraid of his children, than when they went a feaſting from houſe to houſe. Then did he offer a Sacrifice for each of them, leaſt they ſhould blaſpheme God, or had done it. A cheap and ſimple diet may preſerve health and ſtrength as well as the beſt dainties and coſtlieſt varieties. <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> who lived of pulſe and water, were fairer and fatter than all thoſe which did cat the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings meat. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.15. They are ſometimes the leaneſt cattel which devoure the fat. As for any ſervice of God or men, he ſhall be much more fit, who having no pallatable diet, eats but for neceſſitie, and to ſatisfie his hunger; than one that by the deliciouſneſs of his fare, is tempted to devoure more than he can well digeſt. As for delight in meats and drinks: he that brings but hunger and thirſt enough to a courſe meale, ſhall have more of that (and thoſe are ſauces which the poor have uſuallie moſt of) than he that with balfe an appetite ſits down to a great Feaſt. Why then, having a comperencie of wholſome food, though but mean and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, ſhould we not be therewithall content? Are we better then <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that his diet was Locuſts and wilde Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60264:210"/>Some have found more ſweetneſs in a draught of cold water (ſuch as their thirſt hath been) than in all the Wines and Spirits which they have drank at other times? Why then may not a mean diet content us, yea prove delicious to us, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, To the hungry ſoule every bitter thing is ſweet. Povertie brings ſuch ſawce with it, as will make a diſh of Tripe more ſavorie than a Veniſon Paſtie is to a rich man.</p>
                     <p>Then, as for Rayment: if we have but that which may ſerve the turn to keep us warm and decent, though it be courſe and plain: why ſhould we not be content therewith? We read in <hi>Mark</hi> 1.6. <hi>John was cloathed in Camels-hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Heb.</hi> 11.37. Are we better than they? would ſuch habits become us worſe than them? Time was, that God bid the <hi>Iſraelites to put off their ornaments, that he might know what to do with them. Exod.</hi> 33.5. Did God ever ſpeak, as if he knew not what to do with a people for want of ornaments? Did he ever ſeem diſpleaſed that a people were not fine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? Why ſhould that habit diſpleaſe us, that God may beſt like us in, and know what to doe with us? Whilſt we are clad with coſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, it is hard for us at the ſame time to be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with humilitie: yea, not to have pride compaſs us as a chain.</p>
                     <p>Why ſhould not mean houſes ſatisfie us, if God in ſuch will appoint the bounds of our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation? If the primitive Chriſtians were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60264:210"/>with <hi>mountains, dens, and caves of the earth,</hi> as we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. why ſhould we repine at mean dwellings, which yet may anſwer the main ends for which houſes are built; <hi>viz.</hi> warmth, privacie, defence, and ſuch like? were dens and caves better than ſuch houſes? or is it becauſe we think our ſelves better than thoſe that dwelt in deus and caves? Surely neither. It is but a little while that we and ours ſhall have need of any ſuch things, as houſes, food, and rayment; and may not that which is but mean and ordinarie content us for a while? Did not Citizens make ſhift with any thing whilſt the Citie was burning? Glad they were to crowd their goods, their children, yea themſelves into any hole where they could get, and thankful to thoſe that would receive them, and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it, as thinking with themſelves it was but for a while. Well, after a little while thou that cameſt naked into the world ſhalt go naked out of it, and never uſe ſuch clothing more: and whereas meats are for the belly, God ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both them and it.</p>
                     <p>For the preſent then, be content with ſuch things as you have: as travellers uſe to make ſhift with any thing upon a journey: and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers upon a march; ſeeing ſuch things are but for a ſeaſon, and they hope for better afterwards. Lord I am ſenſible that this counſel, <hi>viz.</hi> to be content with food and raiment, is very good. Oh give to me and others a heart to take it. If we need many things, and are not ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the beſt of every thing we need, (of ſuch fort as food and raiment) it is our weakneſs. So people that are ſick would taſte of every bodies

One ſort of drink ſerves him that is in health (let that one be what it will, ſo it be but tollerable) Lord give me that health within my ſoul that I may not long for any thing that is not ſimply needful; nor be diſpleaſed with any thing that is truly good, though not the beſt, (as being humbly perſwaded that every ſuch thing is better than I deſerve) let me not ſeek great things for my ſelf, at any time, but leaſt of all at ſuch a time as this, in which thou haſt <hi>broken down what thou didſt once build up, and plucked up what thou didſt once plant, and ſeemeſt to be bringing evil upon all fleſh:</hi> as thou didſt threaten the <hi>Jewes</hi> of old, <hi>Jer.</hi> 45.5. May I be able to ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 131.2. <hi>I do not exerciſe my ſelf in things that be too high for me: I have quieted my ſelf as a child that is weaned of his Mother: my ſoul is as a weaned child.</hi> Oh give me contentedly to feed on any thing, when thou wilt have me feed no longer on the milk of thoſe more luſcious comforts which I have formerly enjoyed. Let the food of my body be what thou wilt; ſo thou wilt but feed my ſoul with that bread of life which came down from heaven: and let my bodily raiment be ever ſo mean, ſo thou wilt but enable me to put on the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and give me to be cloathed in the garment of that elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the robe of whoſe righteouſneſs is that <hi>white raiment ſpoken of, Rev.</hi> 3.18. which ſuffereth

If I have but food and raiment for my ſelf: the worſt is, I can contribute little, if any thing, to others: but this I know, that <hi>where there is a willing mind, thou accepteſt according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.

He is <hi>rich in good works,</hi> who is <hi>ready</hi> (that is wholly inclined) <hi>to diſtribute;</hi> if he had but wherewithall, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18.

Are ye not much better than they,</hi> verſ. 28. <hi>And why take ye thought for raiment? conſider the Lillies of the Field, how they grow, they toyle not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they ſpin, yet</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe,</hi> verſ. 30. <hi>Wherefore if God ſo cloathe the graſſe, which to day is, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60264:212"/>is caſt into the Oven, ſhall he not much more cloathe you?</hi> I am far from thinking that <hi>Chriſt</hi> by thoſe words of his, intended to encourage idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or to give men to think, that though they could work and would not, yet God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide food and raiment for them; as he doth for the birds, that neither ſowe nor reape, and for the Lillies that neither toile nor ſpin; but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think that thoſe words were ſpoken to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thoſe that would work and cannot, as namely thoſe that are bed-ridden, ſuch as have loſt the uſe of their limbs, or of one or more of their ſenſes, as ſight, hearing, and that ſuch, though unable either to ſowe or reape, (like the fowles of the aire) either to toile or ſpin, like the lillies, yet ought not to doubt, but that he who feedes the one, and cloaths the other, will do as much for them. Why may not thoſe that have the uſe of their limbes and ſenſes (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a heart to make any good uſe of them) be fortified againſt the fear of want by thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which may relieve, even thoſe that want them? Were I lame or blind, or paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or bed-ridden: to think of Gods feeding the Birds and cloathing the Graſſe, might be a ſupport to me: but if I have all my limbes and ſenſes; not only may faith ſwim in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned conſideration of that which God doth for bruites and plants, but there is alſo a ſhallower water, in which reaſon and ſenſe may a little wade. He that can work, and is willing ſo to do, may rationally hope he ſhall not ſtarve.</p>
                     <p>The inſtance I have mentioned was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from providence, which is no ways to be ſlighted. But there are alſo promiſes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60264:213"/>our faith in the caſe. <hi>viz.</hi> that God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie feed and cloathe us; at leaſtwiſe upon ſuch reaſonable termes and conditions, as he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf to do it. Is not that a promiſe plain enough? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord and do good, and verily thou ſhalt be fed.</hi> God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated this promiſe over and over, to let us ſee he is mindful of what he hath ſpoken. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.9, 10. <hi>O fear ye the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him. The young Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> If we deſire a cloud of witneſſes, or co-witneſſing promiſes to ſhield us from the fear of want (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a Pillar of Cloud to ſhelter them in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) it will not be difficult to add many more. Hee in whom all the promiſes are yea and Amen, aſſureth us from his own mouth, that if we <hi>first ſeek the Kingdom of God &amp; his righteouſneſs, all theſe things ſhall be added to us, (Mat.</hi> 6.33.) <hi>viz.</hi> meat, drink and cloathing: for thoſe were the things he had been ſpeaking of, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. The Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is.</hi> Now a ſecurity for food and raiment, one would think were as little as any thing ſo called, can amount to. Moreover in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. It is ſaid, that God <hi>will with-hold no good thing from them that walk uprightly.</hi> So that if food and raiment may be reckoned good things (as things of ſo abſolute neceſſity muſt needs be reckoned ordinarily) then come they within the compaſs of that general promiſe. Examine we one witneſs more, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.3. <hi>The Lord will not ſuffer the ſoul of the righteous to famiſh</hi> (that is the righteous perſon himſelf) I may not omit ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60264:213"/>confiderable teſtimonies, as thoſe which follow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18, 19. <hi>The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, and that hope in his mercy, to keep them alive in Famine. Pſal.</hi> 37.19. ſpeaking of <hi>the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>In the dayes of Famine they ſhall be ſatisfied. Prov.</hi> 5.20. <hi>In Famine he ſhall redeem thee from death.</hi> It is far more difficult to feed men in a time of famine, than of plenty: as it was not ſo eaſie to ſpread a table in the wilderneſs, as in a fruitful Countrey: (I mean for any but God, to whom all things are not only poſſible, but eaſie.) Methinks the promiſes of ſupplies even in famine, ſhould be great ſupport in a time of common plenty, though things be ſcarce with us.</p>
                     <p>But let me take in all thoſe conditions, on which God hath ſuſpended the promiſes of food and raiment, (as I have already mentioned ſome of them) leſt we ſhould think God to fail of his promiſe, when it is only we that fail in thoſe conditions to which it is made.</p>
                     <p>One condition is, that we uſe diligence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. <hi>He becometh poor that dealeth with a ſlack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. Prov.</hi> 19.15. <hi>An idle ſoul ſhall ſuffer hunger,</hi> which plainly implies, that a diligent ſoul ſhall not. It will be a new leſſon to ſome, both old and young to become painſ-takers. They have not known what it meant, to eat their bread in the ſweat of their browes. But they that be afraid of work, ſuch as they are able to performe, are worſe ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than hurt, (as we ſay proverbially) and wil finde that the bread of diligence is far more ſweet, than ever was that of idleneſs. Thoſe that are given to hunt, account the exerciſe as good
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60264:214"/>as the Veniſon, and better too. God puts no hard termes upon us, if henceforth he will make us earne our bread before we eat it, though he have formerly ſo much indulged us, as to let us cat the bread we never earned. Idle perſons have oft times meat without ſtomacks: but painſ-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have both ſtomacks and meat. That houſe ſtands upon able pillars, and is like to laſt, in which every body is addicted to honeſt labour, which is one of the moſt imitable things. I have heard of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that from the time their Children are of any growth or underſtanding, they ſet them to work. They ſeem to have taken warning by thoſe words of <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 10.18. <hi>By much ſloathfulneſs the building decayeth, and thorough idleneſs, the houſe droppeth thorough,</hi> which words made me to ſay, that houſe ſtands upon able pillars, where every body is well implo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed. If that were the worſt fruit of the late fire, that idle perſons of what quality ſoever, were forced to take pains, the matter were not great: yea many would be made better by it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover to our Diligence we muſt add fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality: if we would promiſe our ſelves never to want food and raiment. Frugality is that pruning-hook, which lops off all the unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branches of ſuperfluous expences? God hath no where ingaged himſelf to maintain any mans pride and prodigality: though he hath to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his neceſſity. It is uſual with God to let pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals come to huskes: yea and want them too, before they die, or return. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.21. <hi>The drunkard and the glutton ſhall come to poverty.</hi> It is a fault in thoſe that gain by it, to let their cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have as much wine as they will call for, when
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60264:214"/>they have had enough already: A greater fault in Parents, to let them have money at will, knowing they will ſpend it upon their luſts. It is not then to be expected, that God who hates to ſee men make proviſion for the fleſh, ſhould bind himſelf to give them wherewithall to do it. As therefore we would be ſure of food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let us wiſely conſider what muſt be ſpent, and what may be ſpared. <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura.</hi> He that requires ſuperfluities, is like to want ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries; but he may build upon a ſupply of neceſſaries, who hath learnt to pare off all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities. They are deſires of Gods own creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (and in ſuch a meaſure) which do call but for neceſſaries, as food and raiment: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that made theſe deſires, we may expect will ſatisfie them. But when we crave ſuperſlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, it is ſin that opens its mouth wide, yea which inlargeth it like hell, and what reaſon is there that God ſhould fill it?</p>
                     <p>And as we muſt be frugal, in caſe we would be ſure of food and raiment; ſo one good way is to be mercifull, and ready to diſtribute to the neceſſities of others, ſo long as we have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Frugality and charity may well ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. It is no ill husbandry to lend what we can ſpare upon infallible ſecuritie, and for great advantage. <hi>He that gives to the poor, lends to the Lord.</hi> And if the principal be but a <hi>cup of cold water,</hi> he ſhall have conſideration for it. <hi>Matth,</hi> 10.43. <hi>He ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward.</hi> See <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.24. <hi>There is that ſcattereth, and yet encreaſeth.</hi> Can a man reap, unleſs he firſt ſow? or reap liberallie if he ſow but ſparinglie? Who ſo ſhall read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.1, 2, 3. will finde that one of the beſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60264:215"/>waies never to want our ſelves, is not to let others want if we can help it. <hi>He that conſidereth the poor, God will conſider him;</hi> though he have neither ſtrength, nor certaintie of friends, or money to help him, or hardly one that he can promiſe himſelf will make his bed for him. Where the three laſt mentioned qualifications do meet in Diligence, Frugalitie, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition, it is ſeldom, if ever ſeen, that God doth ſuffer ſuch perſons to want neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: though ſaving grace, and the true fear of God be not found in them.</p>
                     <p>But if any deſire yet further ſecuritie, as for matter of food and rayment; let them conſider what is ſpoken. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.27. <hi>Theſe wait all upon thee, that thou mayſt give them their meat in due ſeaſon. Thou openeſt thy hand, they are filled with good,</hi> viz. Thoſe <hi>innumerable creeping things, both great and ſmall, which are in the Sea,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>v.</hi> 25. alſo <hi>The young Lions which roar after their prey, and ſeek their meat from God,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>v.</hi> 21. alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.15. <hi>The eyes of all wait on thee, thou giveſt them their meat in due ſeaſon. Thou openeſt thy hand, and ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing.</hi> Here we ſhall do well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> that is, doth he not take more care for Mankind, than for Oxen? If then he feed them (and creatures of leſs uſe than they) may we not conclude, he will much more feed us! may not theſe words of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 23.1. afford us ſome reliefe, <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want.</hi> Is not God a ſhepheard to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his people, as well as he was to <hi>David?</hi> Yea are we not in ſome ſenſe his ſheep, as we

                     </p>
                     <p>Should not the extraordinarie waies which God hath taken to ſupplie men with food and rayment, when ordinarie means have failed, be ſome ſtay to us? When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wanted bread in the Wilderneſs, did not God rain down Manna from heaven? and when they wanted water, did he not give it them out of the rock? and whereas there was no cloathing to be had there, did he not keep their garments from wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old, and make them ſerve them forty years? Did not God ſay to <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee;</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they <hi>brought him bread and fleſh in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and likewiſe in the evening. v.</hi> 6.

I have ſomewhere read of a good man, who in the time of the ſiege and famine at <hi>Rochel</hi> was kept alive by a Hen that came every day and laid one egge, one or more in the place where he ledged. Nor do I doubt but there are many
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60264:216"/>true ſtories of as remarkable ſupplies vouchſafed to ſuch as were deſtitute of ordinarie means. Is not God the great houſholder of the world, from whom the whole familie in heaven and earth is named? and do you think he will ſtarve thoſe that are of his familie? howbeit he hath told us, that he who provides not for his own houſhold is worſe than an Infidel? Is not the earth the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof? <hi>Are not all the beaſts of the forrest his, and the cattel upon a thouſand hills? Pſal.</hi> 50.10. And will he ſtarve us (think you) either by the want of food or raiment; whilſt he hath ſuch an overplus of all needful things wherewith to ſupply us?

If we then that are evil will not let our children want whilſt we abound, ſhall we think ſo hardly of God? what if God hath put the world into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens hands, and not into ours? hath he not the hearts of thoſe men in his own hands, and can he not inlarge them towards us, when and as far as he pleaſeth?

He that can make enemies to become our friends, how much more friends to be friendly? Though men be very hard, he can as well make them ſuccour us, as fetch water out of a rock? It is ordinary with God to make them ſhew his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60264:216"/>people moſt kindneſs in their extremity, from whom they did little or leaſt expect it. Thoſe whoſe hearts were ſhut towards us in the time of our plenty, ſhall (it may be) be wide opened in and under our neceſſity. A friend is ſaid to be made for Adverſity: and God makes thoſe friends for his people at ſuch a time, though at other times they were not ſuch. <hi>Elijah</hi> could leſt expect to be ſed by a Raven, of all creatures (from whoſe aptneſs to take, rather than give, comes our word ravenous) neither did the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens do any thing for him till the famine came: but then they were his good purveyors (as God would have it) that brought him all his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We ſhall never know what friends God will raiſe us up till we ſtand in need of them. God will be ſeen in the mount: that is, juſt in the time of extremity; for then is his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

Have we ſeen that which <hi>David</hi> never ſaw in this kind? Take but the ſeed of the righteous for their righteous ſeed, and give inſtance if you can of any of them that have wanted bread, or made a trade of begging it?

                        </gap> they ſhould be brought to huskes, and not have a belly full of them neither; nor is there any likelier way to bring them home. But it is not Gods manner to deal ſo with others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at a time when there is bread ſtirring in the world; (I mean when there is no publick
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60264:217"/>famine, or when the earth yields its increaſe as at other times.)</p>
                     <p>If God bring famine upon a Nation: if he turn a fruitful Land into barrenneſs; I cannot ſay, but in that caſe ſome truly righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may die by famine (as well as others by peſtilence) but there are ſeveral things to relieve us againſt that kind of fear.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the caſe of famine is rare and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Few rich men torment themſelves with fear of want; though if a famine come, ſuch as was in <hi>Samaria,</hi> they muſt want bread as well as others; becauſe it will not be to be had for love or money. But think they God ſeldom viſits a people with cleanneſs of teeth, or comes riding to them upon his pale horſe, to kill with hunger, as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.8. and why ſhould we tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our ſelves with fear that he will do ſo?</p>
                     <p>Again, if good men periſh in and by a common famine, it is becauſe they faile in ſome, or other condition to which the promiſes of being kept alive in famine, are made; as namely, they want faith to truſt God for bread in a time of famine, and ſo it comes to paſs that they want bread: but if that and other conditions on which the promiſes of ſupplies are ſuſpended were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them; God would ſooner rain down bread from heaven, than ſuffer them to ſtarve. So that you ſee good men have a conditional ſecurity for bread, even in a time of famine. But in caſe, through their failing in ſome part of that condition, any of them ſhould come ſhort of the promiſe; here is this to comfort them, that if God do bring them to huskes, yea to want a belly-full of huskes who yet are no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60264:217"/>that is no unrighteous or ungodly perſons (as to the main) it is for no worſe an intent than to fetch them home, ſo much the ſooner to their Fathers houſe, where is fulneſs of bread; that is, to heaven where is fulneſs of joy. But methinks the extremity of Mens fear as to want, might be taken off, by conſidering that if they be but diligent, frugal, mercifully inclined, but eſpecially if the true fear of God be before their eyes, they need not doubt of bread, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the experience of Gods dealing with others, ſave only in time of Famine: nor ſhall they want it then, if they have but hearts to truſt God for it. If there be bread in the Land, you ſhall have part of it. If you can ſhow no inſtances to the contrary, why ſhould you not believe it? If there be no bread in the Land, but an univerſal Famine; rich men muſt want as well as you, who yet fear no want, becauſe they perplex not themſelves with the ſuppoſal of a Famine, which they hope never to ſee.</p>
                     <p>A little more to ſhame our miſtruſt of Gods giving us food and raiment. Let me quote one other Text, and it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpured not his only Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall be not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> Had we not a World of unbelief to deale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, many things I have ſaid in this Chapter, might have been ſpread: but as the caſe ſtands with many, all I doubt is little enough to ſhore up, and to under-prop their tottering faith; which knows not how to truſt God, no not for food and raiment. We little think how we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and undervalue God, whilſt we ſuſpect that he will not ſo much as feed and cloath us.

                     <head>DISCOURSE VI. <hi>Of a good conſcience being a continual feaſt.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HOwever it comes to paſs, the vulgar (and ſeemingly miſtaken) quotation of the cloſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60264:219"/>of that verſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.15. <hi>viz.</hi> in theſe words, <hi>A good conſcience is a continual feaſt,</hi> ſounds much more ſpiritually, and like a ſaying of the Holy Ghoſt, than doth that tranſlation which is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given us, <hi>viz.</hi> in theſe expreſſions, <hi>He that is of a merry heart, hath a continual feaſt;</hi> which they that know no mirth but that which <hi>Salomon</hi> calls madneſs, will be apt to wreſt to a very bad ſenſe. The word tranſlated merry, is in the Hebrew <hi>Tob,</hi> which ſignifieth good, which is a better word in common acceptation than is the word merry: (for that is but too liable to an ill conſtruction) &amp; may I take liberty to alter but that one word, and render the Hebrew Text <hi>verbatim</hi> word for word: A good heart, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual feaſt; when we have compared it with the context, it wil eaſily enough appear that the true ſenſe and meaning is, that which is generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by ſuch a ſaying as this, in that a good conſcience is a continual feaſt. For (if I miſtake not) that Proverb is ſeldom uſed; but by a good conſcience is intended, a conſcience not accuſing, but excuſing; not teſtifying againſt us, but with us, and for us, a conſcience ſpeaking peace, and ſuch as is a comfort and a rejoycing to us. That <hi>Salomon</hi> by a good heart doth intend ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as that; the oppoſition in the foregoing words ſeemeth to imply; <hi>All the daies of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted are evil: but a good heart, &amp;c.</hi> intimating thereby, as if good were here oppoſed to grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, wounded, afflicted: which interpretation is alſo countenanced by what followeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great treaſure and trouble therewith,</hi> probably meaning trouble of mind and conſcience for the ill get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60264:219"/>of it; for other kind of trouble there may be where there is but a little, and that both gotten and enjoyed in the fear of God. And now we know what it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſtileth a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual feaſt, we may be able to ſpeak to thoſe who having with <hi>Dives</hi> fared deliciouſly every day (which now they are not able to do as formerly) think it cold comfort to be told of meer food and raiment, and would be fain feaſting again, if they had wherewithall. Feaſt we may, and that not only now and then, but every day in the year, and every hour of the day, (and upon greater delicacies than any feaſt commonly ſo called conſiſts of) if we can but get that good conſcience <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of to feaſt withall. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no contentment but a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, our bodies admit not of a continual feaſt: but our ſouls do. A full ſtomack loathes the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney comb. But there is no ſatiety in thoſe dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which conſcience feeds upon: much leſſe can we ſurfeit with them. As thoſe that have but almoſt dined, feel no troubleſome ſenſe of hunger, and yet could eat more: ſo a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, though it have that already, which may ſuffice, yet is alwaies left with a wholſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>
                     <p>What can be deſired, or what is ever enjoyed in a feaſt, but good chear, good company, good diſcourſe, mirth, muſick (now and then) as an help to mirth, and above all hearty welcome? I am deceived if a good conſcience do not afford all and every of theſe. Good meats and good drinks are that we count good chear, and if our meats and drinks be both for health and delight, then do we account them good. A good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60264:220"/>affords both meats and drinks, (as they may properly enough be called) as wholeſome and as delightfull as can be wiſhed. Meats and drinks, ſuch as our bodies feed upon, there are none in Heaven. Yet ſomething ſo called there is, elſe why is there mention of <hi>eating bread in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God? Luke</hi> 14.15. or why doth Chriſt ſpeak of <hi>drinking of the fruit of the Vine new in the kingdome of his father? Mat.</hi> 26.29. The bread of comfort, the Wine of joy, is that which Saints and Angels feaſt upon in Heaven; and the ſame for kind, though not for degree is that of a good conſcience. It ſpreads a Table with firſt, ſecond and third courſe. Its preſenting us with a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded perſwaſion of our being delivered from the wrath to come, as the Apoſtle ſaith, we are not appointed to wrath, that is as it were the firſt courſe: it's witneſſing that we are not only not children of wrath, (which alone would be a great comfort to be aſſured of) but alſo that we are the children of God, (as the ſpirit of God is ſaid to witneſs with the ſpirits of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) that is the ſecond; and then its telling us that it is our fathers pleaſure to give us, even us, a kingdome, and cauſing us to rejoyce in hope of the glory of God, that is the third.</p>
                     <p>Nor is a good conſcience better chear than it is good company. As a bad conſcience is the worſt companion in the World: ſo a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the very beſt, unleſs it be God himſelf. He that hath it, is many times never leſs ſolitary than when he is moſt alone, that is the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that is both profitable and pleaſant: and ſo is a good conſcience; it hath that property of a good companion, amongſt others, it will finde
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60264:220"/>good and pleaſant diſcourſe. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks concerning the Law of God, taught by parents to their children, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.22. <hi>When thou goeſh it ſhall lead thee, when thou awakeſt it ſhall talk with thee.</hi> So will a good conſcience. An evil conſcience findes ſuch diſcourſe as men have not patience to hear, like <hi>Micaiah,</hi> it never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth good: but a good conſcience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends without flattery, and tells thoſe ſtories than would not be grievous to a man to liſten to from morning to night. It ſpeaks like God in his ſentence of Abſolution, well done good and faithful Servant. No man can frame a diſcourſe ſo delightful, as are the whiſpers of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſpeaking peace and pardon to us in the name of God. Where ſuch company and ſuch diſcourſe is, there can want no mirth, taking mirth in the ſobereſt ſenſe, for comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; yea it will make the heart more glad than they whoſe wine and oile increaſe.</p>
                     <p>And as for muſick; all the voices and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World cannot make ſuch melody as a good conſcience. If a man had all thoſe <hi>Men-ſingers,</hi> and <hi>Women-ſingers</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> had, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.8. their beſt notes were not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it hard to make out how a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can and doth give a man hearty welcome. For as Chriſt in ſeveral ſenſes is both Prieſt, Altar, and Sacrifice: ſo is that, both our feaſt, and our Hoſt, our entertainer, and our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. Conſcience doth as it were grudge a wicked man, both his meat and his mirth, but to a good man it ſaith, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60264:221"/>Lord accepteth thy perſon. Conſcience bids much good may do him with all he hath, and tells him in the name of God, he is as welcome to it as his heart can wiſh, and hath it with as good a will. We count thoſe men beſt able to feaſt, that have as we ſay every thing about them and within themſelves, Corne, Cattel, Poultry, all of their own, Dove-houſes, Warrens, Parks all within their own grounds, Ponds affording ſeveral ſorts of fiſh, Trees yielding all ſorts of fruits, &amp;c. Such is he that hath a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he hath all materials for feaſting within himſelf, and therefore may afford to do it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. <hi>A good Man ſhall be ſatisfied from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Viz.</hi> from the conſciouſneſs of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, this is our rejoycing, <hi>viz.</hi> the teſtimony of our conſcience, &amp;c. He that hath this, hath meat to eat that the World knows not of, and ſuch meat as he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for all the rarities and varieties that are at Emperors Tables. He bleſſeth himſelf, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, when he thinks how much happeir he is than the World takes him for, and how much better he fares than the World knows of: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they do or may bluſh, and inwardly bleed to think how much happier they are thought to be than indeed they are. I might add, he that feaſts upon a good conſcience, hath that kinde of meat which is alſo ſawce for every thing, whereas others have the ſame ſawce that ſpoiles all their ſweet meat.</p>
                     <p>But poſſibly I cannot ſay more of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a good conſcience, than many can eaſily believe, from the experience of a bad one, and the miſery they have felt by meanes of it. A good
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60264:221"/>conſcience think they were an excellent feaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if we had it. There is none like that, but as <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid, the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> were come up againſt him, and God was departed; ſo they, The Fire is come up againſt them, and hath taken away what they feaſted on before; and as for a good conſcience they wiſh they had it, but they have it not. Such a ſound ſpirit would bear their infirmities, but for want of it, they are not able to bear them. Were I ſure ſuch men were in good earneſt, to look after that good conſcience which they confeſs and complain they want; I would tell them for their encouragement, that there is a way for a bad, yea a very bad conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to be made good; as well as a good one to be made better. Who can think that <hi>Paul</hi> had alwaies a good conſcience? the Scripture telling us that he was ſometimes a perſecutor, an injurious perſon, and a blaſphemer; yea, <hi>that he did compell others to blaſpheme. Acts</hi> 26.12. conſidering that he had his hand in the death of many of Gods Saints. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.12. <hi>Many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon, and when they were put to death I gave my voice againſt them.</hi> But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it is, that he had a good conſcience after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; therefore I ſay there is a way for a very bad conſcience to be made very good, and bleſſed be God there is ſo.</p>
                     <p>It is againſt Scripture to ſay, that a conſcience once deflowred can never recover its virginity. He who himſelf was born of a virgin, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that conſcience to a virgin ſtate, which hath been the mother of many hainous ſins. <hi>Hab.</hi> 9.14. <hi>If the blood of bulls and goats, and the ſprinkling the aſhes of an heifer ſanctifieth to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60264:222"/>of the fleſh: how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt ſanctifie your conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God?</hi> It is ſin alone that defiles the conſcience, and makes it evil: Now ſin is either immediately againſt God, or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt our neighbour, that is, againſt men: and that alſo is againſt God ultimately, though not firſtly and only. Therefore <hi>David</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his ſin in the matter of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> ſaith to God, <hi>Againſt thee have I ſinned.</hi> He that would have a good (that is, a pure and peaceable conſcience) muſt, if he be able, ſatisfie men for the wrongs and injuries done to them: as <hi>Zacheus</hi> reſolved to do; or if he be not able, he muſt be ſincerely willing and deſirous ſo to do, and fully purpoſe it in his heart, if God ſhall ever make him able.

                     <p>When theſe things are once done, namely, when care hath been taken to ſatisfie men, ſo far as we are able, for the wrongs done to them: when we have looked upon him whom we have pierced by ſin, and truly mourned, when we have confeſſed our ſins, and forſaken them, both actually for the preſent, and in ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for ever after: and when we have lifted up all eye of faith to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as to the antitype of that brazen ſerpent, which was lifted up in the wilderneſs, as he that is able to take out the ſting of ſin out of the fiery ſerpent; and by faith laid hold upon his grace, as upon the horns of an altar: I ſay, when this is done, then is that conſcience which was bad, become purely good; and when we can reflect upon what we have done, then do they become not only pure but peaceable, and conſequently good upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. Now I ſee not what notion can be more comfortable to thoſe that have brought a bad conſcience into a bad condition than this, that a conſcience extreamly bad may be made good: that which is impure may become very pure; and that which is unquiet, may become calm and peaceable, yea full of joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
                     <p>This premiſed, I think it no hard matter to tell many a man how he may be much more happie in a mean and impoveriſhed condition, than he had wont to be in midſt of all his plenty and proſperity. Get but a good conſcience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a bad one: Get but peace within, (<hi>viz.</hi> that peace which paſſeth all underſtanding:) get but the pardon of thy ſins, and the well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſwaſion of that pardon: get but a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60264:223"/>of thy ſins as drowned in the red ſea of Chriſt his blood: get but to look upon God as thy friend and father, and upon death as none of thine enemie (and where it is no enemy, it is and will be a great friend;) get but the Spirit of God to witneſs with thy ſpirit that thou art the childe of God: get but this for thy rejoycing, which <hi>Paul</hi> had, <hi>viz.</hi> the teſtimony of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, &amp;c. and let me be miſerable for thee, if thou who haſt wanted theſe things in times paſt, when thou hadſt the world at will, when once poſſeſt hereof, doſt not become more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in the enjoyment of meer food and raiment, than ever thou wert formerly, when waters of a full cup were wrung out unto thee. Some have ſaid, Bread and the Goſpel are good cheere: It is as true, that brown bread and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are ſo. He that hath thoſe two, will finde no cauſe he hath to complain. And as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick: the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity:</hi> ſo neither will men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine that they are poor and deſpicable, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe afflicted, if they come but once to know for certain that they are pardoned.</p>
                     <p>The true reaſon why many men do want ſo many outward good things, as namely ſo much wine, ſo much company, ſo much recreation, &amp;c. is becauſe they want better conſciences: had they more of a good conſcience, to cheare and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh them, they would need leſs of other things. If <hi>Saul</hi> had not been poſſeſſed with an evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, be had not wanted <hi>David</hi> to have plaied to him upon the Harp, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.16. One ſaith, that <hi>the life of a wicked man is a continual Dver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:60264:223"/>If men were not wicked, they would not need the one half of thoſe diverſions which they betake themſelves to, as reliefs againſt the ſting of an evil conſcience. Notable is that counſel of the <hi>Apoſtle, Eph.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is exceſs: but be ye filled with the ſpirit.</hi> v. 19. <hi>making melody in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> When men want the comforts of Gods Spirit, and melody in their own hearts, they would ſupply that defect, if they knew how, with more than ordinary refreſhments, from thoſe good comforts of God which do gratifie and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their ſenſes; and thence probably it is that St. <hi>Jude</hi> joines thoſe two together, <hi>Jude</hi> 19. <hi>Senſuel, having not the Spirit.</hi> They that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe Cordials, are ſuppoſed to be apt to faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: for others had rather let them alone. Wine is obſerved to be a narcorick or ſtupifying thing, (witneſs the proneneſs of men to fall aſleep when they have drunk freely of it) and it is to be feated, that many do uſe it but as opium to conſcience. Now as Phyſitians ſay, the body is much endangered by the over-frequent uſe of opiates, natural opiates; ſo is the ſoul much more by thoſe things which caſt it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent into a dead ſleep; for they do but keep that worm from gnawing at the preſent, which will afterwards gnaw ſo much the more, and never die; ſtupifying things remove not a diſeaſe, but fix it ſo much the more.</p>
                     <p>I ſee then, O Lord, what men muſt do if they would not only think themſelves happy, but be ſo indeed, if they would not be like hungry men that dream they eat, but finde themſelves empty when they awake, or thirſty men that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60264:224"/>dream of drink, but awake and finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deceived. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.8. If they would feaſt in good earneſt, it muſt be by means of a good and quiet conſcience. That men may want though they have houſes full of Gold and Silver: that men may have, though Gold and Silver they have none. Riches cannot give it: poverty cannot hinder it. I am or would be at a point, whether my body feaſt at all, more or leſs; but for my ſoul. I deſire not only a good meale now and then, but that continual feaſt of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience both pure and peaceable. I prefer that to all the far fetcht and dear bought varieties of fiſh, fleſh, and fowle, which are at Princes tables. I ſee then men need not bid adieu to feaſting, or reckon upon a bare commons after all the ſpoile this fire hath made. They need only change their diet for that which is much better than they had wont to live upon, and they may feaſt hereafter ten times for once they did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and be ſaid in a nobler ſenſe than ever <hi>Dives</hi> was, to fare ſumptuouſlie every day. Peace of conſcience is <hi>a feaſt of fat things, full of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and of wines on the lees well refined,</hi> as I may allude to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.16.</p>

                     <p>AS it fareth with children whoſe nurſes have milk enough in both breaſts, but one is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60264:224"/>much hardet to be drawn than the other; they would willinglie lie altogether or moſtlie at that breaſt which may be drawn with moſt eaſe: ſo with many Chriſtians who have an intereſt both in Spiritual and temporal things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſolace themſelves, they are too too prone to live upon the breaſt of their worldlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, which may be ſuckt (as it were) by ſenſe; rather than upon that of their Spiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and advantages; which breaſt (though much the ſweeteſt and fulleſt) can no otherwiſe be drawn than by the exerciſe of faith. Now ſad experience convinceth us, that it is much more hard to exerciſe our faith, than to uſe our ſenſes; even as to draw water out of a deep well with a heavie bucket, is nothing like ſo eaſie, as to fetch it out of a ciſtern, where 'tis but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cock and the work is done.</p>
                     <p>The objects of faith are things remote, and the eye of faith is in its kind more weak than that of ſenſe: and to a weak eye it is much more difficult to view things that are at a great diſtance, than thoſe that are neer at hand. The advantage of a high place, a clear day, and (it may be) of a proſpective-glaſs to boot, may be all little enough to make us diſcerne thoſe things which are afar off: but without any ſuch helps, we can eaſily eſpie thoſe things which are cloſe by us; as are the objects of ſenſe compared with thoſe of ſaith. Why did that good man cry out, <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief? Mark</hi> 9.24. but that he found difficulty in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of faith?

                     <p>The exerciſe of our faith is oppoſed by ſin and ſathan; ſo is not the uſe of our ſenſes. Now men finding it no eaſie thing to ſet faith on work, and to keep that hand in ure, and in action, without which they cannot fetch in the comfort of their ſpiritual priviledges (for the Scripture ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>In whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, we rejoyce;</hi> intimating, that without faith there can be no true rejoycing in <hi>Chriſt</hi>) and ſpeaking of faith,

I ſay, men finding it ſo hard a work to believe, and to fetch in their comfort that way; too often content themſelves with that meaner and lower kind of comfort, which more eaſily flows in upon them, and which doth as it were follow them as the rock, meaning the waters out of the rock are ſaid to have followed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs. Hence it is that whilſt the world ſmiles upon them, they are apt like the fool in the Goſpel, to ſing <hi>requiems</hi> to their ſouls, becauſe they have laid up in ſtore for many years, and their barns are full. And hence it is that when God doth ſtrip ſuch men of earthly enjoyments, and as it were dry up that breaſt; even many good men are for the preſent at a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60264:225"/>very great loſs: not that they want intereſt in better things than are taken from them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have diſuſed themſelves from ſucking at that harder, but ſweeter breaſt, which God hath provided for them, and doth alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to them. They have not accuſtomed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to live by faith, and now they are to ſeek how to do it. Theſe men of might for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent cannot finde their hands. As we grow up we forget to ſuck, becauſe we have not uſed it of a long time, and ſo in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>How neceſſary is it then for Chriſtians, even whilſt earthly enjoyments laſt, to inure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to live upon the hopes and expectations of heavenly good things? As Popiſh Prieſts put off the Laity with but one element, giving them the bread in the Sacrament, but denying them the Cup (which is as due to them, and rather more refreſhing:) ſo do many ſerve themſelves; feeding upon the bread of their temporal poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whilſt they refrain the wine of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hopes and expectations (as to another world) which belong unto them. But how much better were it for them to receive in both kinds? It is good (as our Proverb ſaith) for men <hi>to have two ſtrings to their bowe.</hi> What great heire contents himſelf with thinking only of that ſmall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which he enjoys, being under age, and doth not pleaſe himſelf with muſing how much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things he is like to enjoy hereafter? who that hath both Viol and Lute, and can play excellently upon both, would let his Lute, which is the ſweeter inſtrument of the two, hang by the walls and uſe his Viol only, becauſe that is eaſier to be played upon of the two? Who would pluck
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60264:226"/>only the ſowriſh grapes which are at the bottom of his Vine, becauſe they are next at hand, and mean time neglect thoſe ripe cluſters, which are at the top, becauſe he cannot reach them without a ladder, and the pains of climbing? he enjoyes not the one half of what he might, who lives only or moſtly upon the worſer half of his enjoyments; like a man that ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes live in one of his houſes, every way leſs convenient and pleaſant, and ſuffer another that doth far tranſcend it to ſtand alwayes empty.</p>
                     <p>To what end hath the ſpirit of God made any of us to know the things that are freely given us of God, if we ſolace not our ſelves with the remembrance and conſideration thereof? even then when God hath filled our cup with worldly good things, if not made it to run over. Should we draw waters from thoſe upper Springs whilſt the neather flow plentifully? and are we not as much or more concerned to do it, when the neather ſprings are dried up? when the Fig-tree bloſſomes not, and there is no herd in the ſtall, woe unto us if we know not then (at leaſtwiſe then) how to rejoyce in the Lord; and joy in the God of our ſalvation: haſt thou intereſt in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, and wilt thou not live upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them: no not at a time when thou haſt nothing elſe in effect to live upon? what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Ziglag,</hi> if he had not <hi>encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf in the Lord his God?</hi> So elſewhere, when <hi>David</hi> ſaw his houſe declining; (which made him ſay, though may houſe be not ſo with God) did he not comfort himſelf with this, that yet God had made with him an everlaſting Covenant? who brings not out his old gold and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60264:226"/>precious Jewels to help himſelf withall, when all he had beſides, is ſpent or taken away? ſhall all creatures be wiſer than we? Dogs know their remedies when ſurfeited, <hi>viz.</hi> that they call Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs: and Toades, when poiſoned, theirs (<hi>viz.</hi> Plantane) and fall to them, if they be to be had. Is not an intereſt in ſpiritual things, if we have that, the only relief we have in the loſs of all our temporal comforts? and ſhall we not make uſe of it? if a man have white bread to eat, would he ſuffer himſelf to be ſtarved, becauſe he hath no brown? will he keep it up in his Cup-board when he hath nothing elſe to eat? if you have a ſort of comforts to live upon, beſides thoſe which are taken from you, live upon them: never lie down and die whilſt you have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to live, yea and to live nobly.</p>
                     <p>A ſtock of well-grounded ſpiritual comforts, or a well-bottomed hope of glory will maintain a man at a great rate, though he have little elſe; yea like a Prince, if it be well improved. Have you not known men live chearfully and joyfully upon the expectance of great things in reverſion, though they have had but little in poſſeſſion? One would think the aſſurance (or what is next to it) of a Crown and Kingdome, after a ſhort time of ſuffering, ſhould raiſe and revive us more than the preſent fruition of a great Lordſhip, being all that ever we look for. He that upon Scripture-grounds believes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be an heir of heaven, let him but reflect upon what he believes, and that alone will be a heaven to him upon earth.</p>
                     <p>But do I not hear ſome ſay, they want a ſtock of ſpiritual comforts, or grounds of comfort;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60264:227"/>they have no upper Springs to fetch water from, none of thoſe Rivers which make glad the City of God, and therefore it is that their hearts fail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> them in an evil day. Yea doubtleſs therefore it is that their hearts do faile them, becauſe they either have not an intereſt in God, or if they have, they know it not. Now as that holy man ſaid to his friend touching aſſurance, verily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is to be had, and what have we been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this while? ſo ſay I to you, verily an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God is to be had, and ſee that you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for it. It was a great fault and overſight not to look after it whilſt we had a confluence of other good things: but now other things are taken away, it were utter madneſs to neglect it. From this time forward make it thy buſineſs to get an intereſt in eternal mercies, the ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>David,</hi> and to know that thine intereſt; and then live upon the comfort of it: and then thou that never hadſt it before, though God have caſt thee (as it were) from the throne to the dunghil, even upon that dunghill ſhalt thou live better than ever thou didſt in all thy life before. Doubtleſs a man may live more happily upon a great deale of aſſurance, having but a ſmall pittance of other things, than upon great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of worldly enjoyments, having little or no aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>O Lord my heart deceives me, if the conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God be ſmall with me (or in my accompt) if I could not live more contentedly upon bread and water, with calling and election made ſure, than they who have their portion in this life, do when their Corn and Wine increaſe. Oh why do I preſs no harder after that which I take my
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60264:227"/>ſelf to have ſo great a value for? That is the only thing that makes me fear, leaſt my heart ſhould in this caſe deceive me. For it is not that God hath been wanting to incourage the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of men in purſuite of ſpiritual and eternal mercies, ſo that we ſhould have cauſe to fear our labour would be in vain; for hath he not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he is a rewarder of all them that ſeek him diligently? and that <hi>to them who by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in well doing ſeek glory, he will give eternal life, Rom.</hi>

                        </gap>. And what more could have been ſaid?</p>
                     <p>I ſee then there are three ſorts of men. Some have matter and ground-work for ſpiritual joy, but will not take pains to improve it; they have (as it were) the breaſt in their mouths, but will not draw it, becauſe the milk is hard to come by, that is, they have good evidences for heaven, but will not trouble themſelves to clear them up; and to be ever and anon reviewing and reading them over. Lord if I be one of them, give me to ſee how much I ſtand, and have ſtood in my own light, how much I have leſſened my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts by grudging my paines, how I might have doubled and trebled my joyes, if the fault had not been my own, others there are that content themſelves with a portion in this life, ſeeing and knowing themſelves as yet to have no intereſt in better things. Lord how deſperately do they adventure? how great a hazard do they run? If death ſhould come and finde them provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only for this preſent World, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them? And yet there is a ſort of men more deſperate than theſe, (if more can be) and they are thoſe who are deſtitute of this World's good things, and yet neither have an intereſt in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60264:228"/>ſpiritual comforts, nor yet regard to have any. God hath taken the World from them, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly will never give it them again, do what they can, and yet they look not after that better portion that can never be taken away from them. To ſuch I may ſay, not only what will they do in their latter end, but what will they do at preſent, what ſhift can they make ſo much as for the preſent? can men live of nothing: without either heaven, or earth, God, or the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, comforts for either ſoul or body? where are they but in hell, who are neither in heaven nor yet upon the earth? (in the World I mean) Surely ſuch men care not what becomes of them. I cannot better compare them to any thing than to a ſhip turned adrift in a mighty ſtorm, whoſe Pilot ſteeres her no longer, but expoſeth her to the mercy of winds and waves, and rocks, and ſands, and it is a thouſand to one if ever ſhe get ſafe to harbour. Lord of all ſorts of men, let me be none of this laſt. Let me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure one World at leaſt, and if but one, let it be the World to come. The more thou abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me of earthly comforts; the more inſatiable let me be in my deſires of thoſe that are heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? The more hungry thou keepeſt me, as to a ſupply of earthly things, the more thirſty let me be after thoſe rivers of pleaſure, which are at thy right hand for ever more. O Lord, if I want a ground-work for ſpiritual joy, a root of peace within my ſelf, let me want it no longer; if I have a foundation for joy within me, but know it not: oh thou who haſt given me to have it, give me alſo to know it; and when I once know it, give me often to review and recollect
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60264:228"/>it, to ruminate and chew the cud upon it, that I may enjoy the ſweetneſs of that, whereof I am really poſſeſt; that I may eat the fruit of the Vineyard, which thou haſt planted within me. Lord truſt me with a ſtock of ſpiritual comforts: with plenty of good hope thorough grace: kiſs me with the kiſſes of thy mouth, and let thy barner over me be love, and give me to ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhaddow of thy favour with delight; and if ever I envy thoſe pittiful worldlings that have more of this than heart can wiſh, but no more of any World but this, if ever I be willing to change conditions with them, (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) though they be wealthy, honourable, powerfull; I poor, mean, deſpicable: let me forfeit all again, yea take thou the forfeiture of all thy ſpiritual comforts again, which yet I would not thou ſhouldſt do for ten thouſand Worlds.</p>

Nor yet the words of <hi>Job</hi> to the ſame effect. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.15. <hi>My ſoul chooſeth ſtrangling and death
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60264:229"/>rather than life;</hi> nor yet that peremptory anſwer of <hi>Jonah,</hi> when God asked him if he did well to be angry for the gourd? who told God to his face, <hi>He did well to be angry, even unto death. Jonah</hi> 4.9. Theſe things are not recorded in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of any of theſe three Men, but as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf; I ſaid this is my infirmity: ſo may we ſay, theſe were their infirmities; they were good men, but theſe were bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and are delivered to us, not for our imitation, but for our warning and caution; and as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Theſe things were our examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted.</hi> But how incident is it to us to do the ſame thing, even to wiſh for death, when God hath deprived us of many comforts of life, which formerly we enjoyed: as if it were not worth while to live, unleſs it be in wealth, honour and proſperity.</p>
                     <p>This is ſuch a pernicious error, that I am very zealous to confute it, and to eſtabliſh that uſeful principle which is contrary to it; namely, that to eſcape with our lives is a very great mercy; though we have no ſuch comfortable livelihoods as we had wont to have: yea though a bare livelihood or meer ſubſiſtence be all we have. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith in one place, <hi>I am eſcaped with the skin of my teet, Job</hi> 19.20. meaning very poor and bare. As <hi>Deodate</hi> parallels it with a proverb ſome uſe, that <hi>ſuch a one hath nothing left him but his teeth.</hi> Though it may ſeem a paradox, yet it is a very truth; that it is a great mercy to moſt people living under the Goſpel, to eſcape (<hi>viz.</hi> death and the grave) though it be but with the skin of their teeth: that is, in as bare a condition
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60264:229"/>as bare can be, and live; to live, though it be uncler poverty, diſgrace, reſtraint, and many evils more. Whilſt the pride and paſſion of Men ſuggeſt the contrary: Nature it ſelf gives them the lie, and votes for living, when they vote for death: as <hi>the fable of the Countrey-man,</hi> doth ingenuouſly intimate, <hi>who being weary with his bundle of ſticks, laid it by, ſate down and wiſhed for death: death over hearing him, came and deſired to know what he had to ſay to him. Nothing, replyed the Country-man, but that thou wouldſt help me up with my burthen.</hi> Shewing that he was more willing to take up his burthen again, than to lay down his life. Why ſhould a <hi>Man give all he hath for his life,</hi> (<hi>Job</hi> 1.) if life be nothing worth, when all a man hath is gone? Were the enjoyment of honour, riches, pleaſure, the only or the greateſt end of life: when thoſe were once taken away, it would be ſcarce worth while to live; nay death might be more elegible of the two: but ſeeing the great ends of life are ſuch things, as are as much within the reach of thoſe that are poor, deſpiſed, afflicted, and that <hi>never eat with pleaſure,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Job</hi> 20.25. As thoſe who are rich, renowned, abounding with pleaſures, <hi>whoſe breaſts are full of milk, and their bones moiſtned with marrow, who are wholly at eaſe and quiet;</hi> as it is expreſſed, <hi>Job</hi> 21.23, 24. I ſay, foraſmuch as the great ends of life are as purſuable, and as attainable by the former, as by the latter of theſe; as well the afflicted, as the proſperous ought to look upon the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their lives, as a very great mercy.</p>
                     <p>Surely the great ends of life are; that whilſt it is called to day we ſhould mind the things that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60264:230"/>concern our eternal peace: that <hi>we ſhould ſeek after God, if haply by ſeeking after him we may finde him out, Acts</hi> 17.27. That we ſhould <hi>lay up a good foundation for the time to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. That we ſhould now ſowe what we deſire hereafter to reape, <hi>viz. To the ſpirit, that we may of the ſpirit reape life everlaſting, Gal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>that we might fight a good ſight, finiſh a good courſe, keep the faith, and ſo become aſſured, that henceforth is laid up for us a crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. Theſe are the things which God did principally aime at in beſtowing life upon Men, and to which he would have all the good things that Men enjoy, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated: yea and all their evil things made ſome way or other ſubſervient: theſe are the greateſt improvements that can be made of our lives, and the beſt uſes we can turn them to; therefore theſe are the great ends of life. Had <hi>Moſes</hi> thought otherwiſe, he had not <hi>eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt, greater riches than the treaſures in Egypt: or choſen to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, Heb.</hi> 11.25.26. <hi>Job</hi> could eaſily have anſwered that queſtion which himſelf puts, <hi>Job</hi> 3.20. <hi>Wherefore is life given to the bitter in ſoul which long for death, which are glad when they can finde the grave?</hi> I ſay he could eaſily have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his own queſtion, if he had not been in too great a paſſion; for he knew full well that the great ends of life were thoſe that I have mentioned, and therefore reſolved accordingly that <hi>all the dayes of his warfare he would wait till his change ſhould come, viz.</hi> preparing for it, as one that did remember, <hi>that if a Man die, he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60264:230"/>ſhall never live again, viz.</hi> to amend the errors, and to ſupply the defects of his former life, <hi>Job</hi> 14.14. Now what ſhould hinder but that a poor Man may purſue ſuch ends of life, as well as one that is rich: yea the Scripture ſpeaks, as if it were <hi>harder for a rich Man</hi> of the two: <hi>Luk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But on the baſe heart of man, that will not ſuffer him to know how great a mercy life is, becauſe it will not ſerve him to improve it! A life ſo ſpent as multitudes of people do ſpend theirs, will prove a curſe rather than a bleſſing, as having done little in it, but treaſured up wrath againſt the day of wrath.

                        <hi>Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> It is ſurely a peace which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all underſtanding, that can guard the heart and mind againſt all that might otherwiſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, but juſt before, <hi>Seven times a day do I praiſe thee</hi> (which ſhews how well he imployed himſelf) and then he preſently adds, <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law.</hi> I have pitched upon this conſideration, becauſe there are ſome who ſince the Fire do even deſpaire of ever receiving ſo much good in and from the world as they have formerly done: from their trades, becauſe they are leſſned: their eſtates, becauſe they are impaired; their friends, becauſe they are impoveriſhed. Now to ſuch it may be a great relief; to think they may receive as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by doing, as ever they have formerly done by receiving good: yea, and they may do as much good as ever they did (I do not ſay as ever they could) when yet they receive nothing like ſo much. Some Stars receive leſs light from the Sun, which yet give more light to the world: ſome ſmaller lights are greater luminaries; ſo may the world be better by us, and for us, than it had wont to be; when yet it was never ſo bad (that is ſo unkind and ſo unpleaſant to us, and ſo ſtraight-handed) as now it is.</p>
                     <p>There are more waies of doing good than with a mans purſe onely (though that is one way in which all muſt do good that have it.) Men may do good with their heads, hearts, tongues, pens, lives: by their prayers, parts, graces, precepts, examples: moſt men have one talent or other wherewith to do good, though many have no hearts to uſe their talents, though
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60264:234"/>they be many and great. Men of great eſtates do not alwaies keep the beſt houſes, or give the moſt relief to their poor neighbours; neither are the ableſt men in any kinde, alwaies the moſt uſeful and ſerviceable to the publick. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as able (it may be) as thoſe that write Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, have never once appeared in print; yea, ſome of meaner gifts have furniſhed the world with many uſeful Treatiſes; which ſhews that they who have received leſs, may do more for God, more for themſelves, more for the good of the Church, and of the world, than thoſe who have received a great deal more; who it may be are either over idle, or over-baſhful, or too much awed by that <hi>Proverb, That he that comes in print, lies down and ſuffers every one that will to have a blow at him;</hi> being over-tender of their reputations, like the delicate woman, that for delicacie will not ſet the ſole of her foot to the ground (leſt it ſhould be any waies ſoiled or ſullied) or hoping to ſeem greater by concealing themſelves; like thoſe Eaſtern Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that would not be ſeen of their ſubjects, becauſe they would not be known to be but men. Or as if that which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, is the way for a fool to be thought wiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his peace, were alſo the way for a wiſe man to be thought wiſer. It is all in all in point of ſerviceableneſs, when men of but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perent abilities do with the bleſſing of God ſet themſelves to do good, and to be uſeful, they out-ſerve many that out-ſhine them; and have more comfort in two talents wel improved, than others have in five that lie dead upon their hands. Some are all for the Rake, that is, what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60264:235"/>and other good things they can ſcrape together for themſelves: but thoſe that are for the Pitch-fork (in a good ſenſe) <hi>viz.</hi> for laying out, as well as laying up, ſhall have more peace. <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth good things. Matth.</hi> 12.35. What ſhould a woman do with full breaſts, if ſhe will not ſuffer them to be drawn? How many fine children hath ſome one poor woman brought up with her own breaſts, whilſt many gallant dames of ſtronger conſtitutions, and that might have made abler nurſes, never gave ſuck to one of their own children? Creatures without life do act <hi>ad extremum virium,</hi> the fire burns as much as ever it can burn: but ſo doth not man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in many caſes, becauſe we limit the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our power by the pleaſure of our wills: and therefore may be able to do more good in an afflicted, than ever we were willing to do, in a proſperous condition. The good which we receive may refreſh our ſenſes, but it is the good we do, that will more rejoyce our conſciences. <hi>David</hi> tells us, that <hi>In keeping Gods commands there is great reward, Pſal.</hi> 19.11.

                     <p>ONe of the beſt waies that I know for the great loſs ſuſtained by the late Fire (and all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60264:237"/>other temporal loſſes to be made up to us, is, by promoting a Brief (as it were) amongſt relations and friends (if it may take) to contribute to the reparation each of other: which may ſeem a great paradox; that thoſe who have been mutual and joynt-ſufferers, ſhould be recruited by a collection made amongſt themſelves. But ſo it is, the wives may greatly help to repair what their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands have loſt; husbands what their wives: children the loſſes of their parents; and parents the loſſes of their children; ſervants the loſſes of their maſters, &amp;c. My meaning is, let each of theſe, give themſelves to be more uſeful and comfortable each to other in the relation, in which they ſtand one to another, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution they ſhall make in ſo doing, will be very conſiderable; even in proportion to ſo great a loſs. The comfort or diſcomfort of a relation (ſuch as it may be) may ſignifie more than the gaining or loſing a great part of an eſtate, if not the whole. How many good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents would chearfully part with more than half of their eſtates, on condition they might be able to ſay of ſome one or more of their bad chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as that father of his returning prodigal? <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24. <hi>This my ſon was dead, and is alive; was loſt, and is found.</hi> The miſerable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this dolefulleſt of fears, never coſt ſome parents half thoſe ſighs and tears, that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of ſome one childe hath done: nor would it refreſh them ſo much to ſee <hi>London</hi> once again in its former glory, as to ſee their children brought into an eſtate of grace.

Let children that were formerly otherwiſe, but become hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſerious, contented, diligent, dutiful, and above all, truly religious, evidencing the power of godlineſs to be in them; their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that are ſuch, will eaſily acknowledge that God hath given them more in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than he took from them out of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, though they loſt many thouſands by the fire. If ever children that have almoſt broke their parents hearts, may ſo time their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Repentance, as to do their parents as much good as they have done them hurt, now is the time; if they ſhall labour to comfort them after ſo great a loſs, by giving them occaſion to celebrate their birth-day, (I mean the day of their new birth) whilſt they are yet in mourning for the deſtruction of <hi>London.</hi> Surely the ſoul of a childe to a religious parent is more than the glory of a City.</p>
                     <p>Can yoke fellows do nothing towards repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the loſſes each of other? What if husbands and wives ſhould more ſtudy and practice the duties of their reſpective relations? what if they ſhould pleaſe each other more for their good, to edification? what if there ſhould be a mutuall contention between them, which ſhould love and oblige the other moſt, and no contention but that? what if they ſhould bear more with each others infirmities, and ſeek the comfort of each others lives, as of their own? what if they ſhould ſtrive which of them ſhould bear the loſs moſt patiently, and moſt Chriſtian-like, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60264:238"/>ſhould moſt comply with the law of their new and mean condition? what if bad husbands ſhould henceforth become good, and good husbands better, and wives the like; would it no waies compenſate the loſs which hath been ſuſtained? Surely it would very much; yea, thoſe that know how great a croſs ſome maſters have had, and have in their ſervants, what with ſtubbornneſs, negligence, unfaithfulneſs, &amp; other ill qualities; eſpecially thoſe that have matters of great truſt to employ them in, cannot but think it would greatly comfort them after their loſſes, if thoſe ſervants of theirs, <hi>Oneſimus</hi>-like, ſhould of unprofitable become profitable, and of rebels converts.

And what is it, but that your children may become wiſe unto ſalvation, that they may <hi>know the God of their fathers, and may ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> exhorteth <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28 9. That the diſobedient may be reduced to the wiſdom of the juſt, that they may be born again, and may be found in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having the righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith: In a word, that they may attain that holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord. For this care God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>I know Abraham, that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> As for giving your younger children high and genteele breeding: may not that be ſpared? if God hath taken away the eſtates you had provided for them, what would ſuch breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do, but raiſe their ſpirits above what their condition is like to be, as the caſe now ſtands?
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60264:239"/>and may not a plainer education better fit them for that courſe of life, to which the providence of God is like to call them? As for your elder chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, either they are thoſe bad ones you ſpeak of, thoſe Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> and why ſhould you covet great eſtates for them? would they not conſume them upon their luſts? would not the proſperity of ſuch fooles ſlay them? (as it hath done many others) and would not all thoſe great things be converted by them either into the luſts of the fleſh, or the luſt of the eye, or the pride of life? As for thoſe of your children that are now towardly, but not religious; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will come to have grace in time, or not: If not, there will be a ſmaller accompt to give for a ſmall eſtate, than for a great one, and it may be leſs of a ſnare in it; but on the other hand, if God ſhall firſt or laſt beſtow his ſaving grace, either on your children that are meerly civil, or on them that are prophane, or on both, trouble not your heads any further about them, godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come: God will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold no good thing from them that do, or ſhall walk uprightly before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.</p>
                     <p>Now from theſe premiſes, how naturally may we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nfer, that the great care that is incumbent upon Parents, is, that their children may come to be truly gracious. Grace without eſtates will certainly make them, (though an eſtate with grace, like an inheritance with wiſdome, would add ſomething to them for the preſent) but an eſtate without grace would probably undo them; or if not be their very undoing, yet would aggravate their condemnation very much.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60264:240"/>It may be your childrens advantage, that you are ſenſible, that if God be not their portion, they will have none at all, (or very little) becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it may be you had intruſted them with the World, and never lookt after an intereſt in God for them. That your children may be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with Grace, if you educate them by a <hi>proxy,</hi> let me adviſe you to make choice of thoſe that will truly concern themſelves for the good of their ſouls, and as much to breed them chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as ſcholars; and make it your earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to them ſo to do.

Whereſoever you ſend them, let your earneſt prayers daily follow them: and for this above all things, that God would write his Law in their hearts, and put his fear into them, that they may never depart from him. If you train them up at home, bring them betimes acquainted with the holy Scriptures (which <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſaid to have been inſtructed in from a Childe) alſo with the Grounds and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, that they may underſtand both Scripture and Sermons: be droping whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome counſel into them ever and anon; be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing them with the danger of ſin, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of holineſs, the neceſſity of being new creatures, the doctrines of heaven and hell, and ſuch like great truths; fill their memories with ſuch paſſages of Scripture as do moſt concern them, which may both direct their practiſe, and keep out bad thoughts; Diſcountenance all the manifeſt ſin you ſee by them, as lying, filthy

Not only pray for them your ſelves, but beſpeak the prayers of others, together with your own for them, and take that for one of the greateſt kindneſſes that can be done for you. Principle them againſt the moſt dangerous errours of the times and places they live in: (as Popery where that ſpreads, &amp;c.) Intice them to be much in reading good books, and for that end furniſh them with thoſe that are pleaſant, as well as profitable. Acquaint them with ſignal paſſages of divine providence, thereby to breed in them awfull apprehenſions of God, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60264:241"/>commanded to tell their children the reaſon of the Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26. Verſe them in the Hiſtory of Martyrs, which may ſhew them the faith and patience of the Saints, and acquaint them with the doctrine of the croſs. Keep them alwayes in action, to prevent the miſchiefes that come by idleneſs. Get Maſters for them as ſoon as they are fit to go out, and before they grow too ſturdy to bear the Yoak, or make them ſo ſubject and ſerviceable, in their nonage, in your own houſes, that they may diſcern no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt home and an Apprentiſhip, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Fathers and a Maſters houſe. Breed them rather beneathe, than above what you can do for them: uſe them to be contented with any thing that is fitting, for matter of cloaths &amp; diet. Let morning and evening be (as it were) your medicinal times, in which to give them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for their ſouls health, next their heart in a morning, next their reſt at night. Be ever and anon phyſicking them for wormes, that is, take heed of ſuffering them to be humourſome, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and hard to pleaſe. Make them pay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to your perſons, that they may reverence your counſel. Give them thoſe repreſentations of God, as may cauſe them as well to thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, to love and delight in him, as to fear and ſtand in awe of him: and thoſe characters of Religion, as may cauſe them to look upon all its ways as pleaſantneſs, &amp; all its paths as peace, as an eaſie Yoak and a light burthen. Teach them to be humble, and then God will teach them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9.

                     <p>I Honour the wiſdome of <hi>David,</hi> who when God gave him his election of one evil out of three, (which he would) made choice of that which might ſeem to come more immediately
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60264:242"/>from God, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Plague) ſaying, <hi>Let us fal now into the hand of the Lord,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.15.</note> and let me not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hand of Man,</hi> and the reaſon he gives, is, <hi>becauſe his</hi> (that is Gods) <hi>mercies are great</hi> (or many.) It is a great relief in and under troubles to look upon our ſelves as in Gods hands, and upon the nature of that God (in whoſe hands we are) as far better than is the nature of any, even the beſt natured of men. They miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue <hi>David,</hi> that think he intimates, as if men were not alwaies in the hands of God, in every kind of affliction that befalls them (be it ſword, or famine, by ſiege) for all he meaneth is, that as to ſome troubles, we do not fall into the hand of men, but of God: as namely under the plague, which is an Arrow ſhot from God's bow, not from Man's. Men are called <hi>God's hand, Pſal.</hi> 17.14. <hi>From Men which are thy hand,</hi> ſo that when under the rage of men, we are in the hand of God; but we may be in the hand of God and not of men. (By the way, what furious creatures are wicked men, that <hi>David</hi> ſhould be more afraid of Gods puniſhing him by their hand, than by plague, or famine.)</p>
                     <p>That under all our troubles we are in Gods hand, is clear. Be alſo convinced, that that is to be in a good hand, that you are in a good hand, when in the hand of God, and that will comfort you exceedingly. If the nature and diſpoſition of God be very good, tranſcendently good, that is, kind, and gracious, and mercifull, as the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us in ſundry places, it is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.17, 31. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.13. (With an hundred more in the old Teſtament, beſides the new) then muſt we needs be in a good hand
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60264:242"/>when we are in Gods hand. Is a Childe ſafe in the hand of his tender mother, even when ſhe hath a Rod in her other hand? and are not Gods Children well in the hand of their heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who hath ſaid to his Church, <hi>though a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may forget her Childe, yet will not I forget thee, Iſa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>I have graven thee upon the palmes of my hands, &amp;c.</hi> Methinks that heathen <hi>Poet</hi> ſpake divinely, who ſpeaking of the love of God to man, (underſtand him but of good men, if of a love of complacency; but of others alſo, if of a love of benevolence) <hi>Charior eſt illis homo quam ſibi.</hi> Man is more dear to them, meaning to the Gods, (which plural number is the only thing in that ſaying, that diſcovers the Author to have been a heathen, and not an eminent Chriſtian) than he is to himſelf: or God hath more love for men, than they have for themſelves. That text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31. <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God;</hi> if rightly underſtood, no wayes contradicteth what I have ſaid: for it is meant of ſo falling into the hands of God, as they muſt do, who <hi>have trodden under foot the Son of God, counted his blood an unholy thing, and done deſpight to the ſpirit of Grace, verſ.</hi> 29. for that is to fall, not under the meer correcting, but the revenging and conſuming hand of God, as he hath ſaid, <hi>vengeance is his, verſ.</hi> 30. he will pour out fiery indignation upon the adverſaries, <hi>v.</hi> 27. meaning ſuch Apoſtates as after illumination turn enemies to Chriſt and his truth. But what is that to others? It is ill for the rejecters and oppoſers of Chriſt, to fall into the hand of God. God out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> eſpecially to them that ſet themſelves againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is wrath. But it is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60264:243"/>terrible. But it is well for the accepters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to fall into Gods hand, for God in and thorough <hi>Christ</hi> is unſpeakably gracious.</p>
                     <p>He is partly an Infidel that would have more aſſurance of the ſweet nature and diſpoſition of God, than Scripture and experience; but if the weakneſs of ſuch men may be condiſcended to; I can preſently call in ſound reaſon for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Who ſhed abroad all that love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and compaſſion, and tenderneſs in the hearts of men and women, fathers and mothers, that is there found? who taught men to know that love, and pitty, and mercy, are real excellencies and perfections: but hatred and cruelty are odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deteſtable things, the fruits of ſin and weakneſs? that what we call good nature doth as much excell that we call ill nature, as light doth excell darkneſs? who hath given us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that to do good, and to ſhow mercy, are ſacrifices acceptable to God; but fury and violence his ſoul bateth. Hath not God himſelf taught us theſe things, and is it not therefore, that the <hi>Gemiles</hi> are ſaid to <hi>do by nature the things of the Law?</hi> and that, <hi>they that have not the Law, are a Law to themſelves, and do ſhow the work of the Law written in their hearts, Rom.</hi> 1. Is it not becauſe love and mercy are agreeable to Gods nature (the Scripture ſaith, <hi>God is love</hi>) that he hath commended them to us, and made us to ſee a beauty in them, and to apprehend that God is therewithall delighted, and that with the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he will ſhew himſelf mercifull? Is it not therefore, that God hath called his mercy his glory, and told us that <hi>mercy rejoyceth againſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60264:243"/>judgment, James</hi> 2.13. Much of our diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under affliction proceedeth from miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings of God's nature, and of his heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and for that we think we ſee a ſword in the hand of an enemy, when it is only a Rod in the hand of a father. Therefore it is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent advice, that we ſhould acquaint our ſelves with God in order to being at peace, <hi>Job</hi> 32.21.</p>
                     <p>O Lord I know it is neceſſary I ſhould be ſometimes chaſtned, and better by thy hand than by any other. Thou knoweſt how to do it in mercy and in meaſure: Parents may correct their children for their pleaſure; but thou chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty hine for their profit, I ſhall count my loſſes a fruit of thy love, if thou wilt but tell me that I am therefore chaſtned of the Lord, that I may not be condemned with the World.</p>

(and to other believers in and with him) <hi>that by thoſe two immutable things, the heires of promiſe might have ſtrong conſolation.</hi> The end of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes is, that God who was and had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60264:244"/>free to do or not to do ſuch good things for us, might (as it were) enter into bond, (which he could no otherwiſe do) and might give us the ſecurity of his truth and faithfulneſs, as well as that other of his mercy and goodneſs. God knowing that we could no waies bind him, that is, oblige him in point of juſtice, or as indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible objects of his mercy (which in our ſelves we were not) to ſhow kindneſs to us, hath bound himſelf by his own voluntary promiſes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his truth (which cannot faile) on behalf of his power and wiſdome, and other attributes, that they ſhall be ſo and ſo imploied for us which otherwiſe we could at moſt but have hoped, but may be now aſſured of, as we are, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to lie.

                     <p>I may recite but the heads of promiſes, relate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to adverſity, and it may be not all of them neither. There are promiſes of God's ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people under affliction, ſanctifying it to them: vouchſafing them his gracious preſence in it; and delivering them out of it in due time. And what more can we deſire, than to be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably delivered out of trouble, and mean time to be upheld in it, bettered by it, and to have God with us, as he was with the three Children in the fiery Furnace. I ſhall quote but a few promiſes of this nature, and the rather becauſe they deſerve to want comfort, who wil not ſearch the Scripture for it, that thorough patience and comfort of the Scripture they might have hope. If men had no Bibles, nor could come by none.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60264:244"/>I would not do them that wrong, as to faile of quoting any one ſuch promiſe, that I could call to mind: but now one inſtance of each ſort may ſerve the turn. As for the promiſe of ſupport under affliction; it is as plain as words can make it, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the temptation make a way to eſcape: that you may be able to bear it.</hi> Then, as for the preſence of God with his people in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt thorough the waters, I will be with thee, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>He hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> That their afflictions ſhall be ſanctified, is ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Gods people by thoſe words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.</hi> And <hi>laſtly,</hi> as for deliverance out of trouble, (which ſome do, but ought not moſt of all to thirſt after) there are many texts, that give us to expect it, as namely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.9. <hi>The Lord will not alwayes chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever.

                     <p>IT is a ſign that <hi>Men walk in a vain ſhew</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.6.) for that they are apt to be diſquieted at thoſe things which ſhould comfort them (ſo was <hi>Peter</hi> at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> crying out, depart from me O Lord) and on the other hand, to be comforted with thoſe things which one would think would rather diſquier them, as namely with others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſame, or other as great calamities as themſelves. <hi>Solamen miſeris ſocios habuiſſe dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> Though we may not ſay, the more (in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings together) the merrier, yet according to the courſe of men ſo it is, that the more fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſufferers, the leſs ſad are they that ſuffer. Neither may we impute this wholly to the weakneſs and envirouſneſs of men, ſith the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> from that very conſideration, doth labour to comfort Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>No temptation hath take you but what is common to men:</hi> and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. <hi>The ſame afflictions are accompliſhed in your brethren, that are in the World.</hi> Therefore doubtleſs there is ſome reaſon why men ſhould not be ſo much dejected, when they conſider themſelves not to be alone in miſery, (though upon other accompts again we ſhould be never
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60264:247"/>leſs ſad and ſolitary, than when none are in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but our ſelves) then if they were as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.7. <hi>Like a Sparrow alone upon the Houſe top, or like a Pellican in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, or like an Owle in the Deſart.</hi> For in that caſe we might be apt to think that God had ſome particular controverſie with us more than with all other men, that he had ſingled us out to make examples of us, that he had ſet us like beacons upon a hill to warn and alarm others, or that our ſufferings were ſuch as could not be borne, becauſe we have no inſtances of thoſe that do or ever did bear the like.</p>
                     <p>Now the commouneſs of ſufferings, and thoſe of the ſame kind to others with our ſelves, doth much take off from all thoſe ſuſpicions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, eſpecially if they be ſuch as we doubt not, but have intereſt in the love and favour of God, for thence may we conclude that hatred is not to be known by ſuch diſpenſations as thoſe.

                     <p>But it is otherwiſe at this day, God having caſt multitudes both of perſons and families at one and the ſame time into one and the ſame furnace, that none might ſay, others were corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but with rods, but we with ſcorpions. Now this being ſo, there are the more to pitty you, the fewer to inſult over you: though when all this is ſaid, I honour them that ſay from their hearts, They wiſh they had ſuffered more than they did (if more could have been) if it had been the will of God that none might have been ſufferers but they. But ſeeing ſuch was the good will and pleaſure of God, that thouſands ſhould be involved in the ſame cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with our ſelves, and many of them our betters: who is not aſhamed, yea who is not afraid to contend with God for what hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen himſelf? who ſeeth not reaſon to ſtand before God like a ſheep dumb before the ſhearer? Who would not lay his mouth in the duſt if there may yet be hope?

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is well I have Scripture to back me, elſe I foreſee I might poſſibly have been eſteemed both hard-hearted and heretical, for ſaying that all temporal afflictions are but light: Whereas ſome would oppoſe their experience to ſuch an aſſertion, I may comply with that, and yet do the Scripture right. All your experience can contend for, is only this, that ſome temporal afflictions (and this in particular) abſolutely and in themſelves conſidered, are not light, but heavie (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>like the ſands of the ſea.</hi> That I can afford to grant I but yet thoſe very afflictions relatively conſidered, and compared with miſeries of another nature; namely, with internal and eternal torments, give me leave to ſay are but as ſo many flea-bitings. Say who
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60264:248"/>dare that utmoſt poverty is comparable either to the pains of hell, or pangs of conſcience. Who is ſo deſperate as to be willing to exchange meer beggery or famine its ſelf, with either of thoſe? Doth not <hi>Salomon</hi> ſay, and is it not moſt true, That the <hi>ſpirit</hi> (meaning the conſcience) <hi>of a man</hi> (if that be ſound and in peace) <hi>can bear his infirmities, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> That is, none can bear. If <hi>Job</hi> ſitting upon the dunghill, can then and there ſay, he knows that his redeemer liveth, and he ſhall one day ſee him with theſe eyes; he that thinks him half ſo miſerable whilſt he can ſo ſay, as one that ſits upon a throne, and mean time ſeeth the hand-writing of God upon the wall, (as <hi>Belteſhazzar</hi> did) telling him that he is weighed and found too light: or cries out with <hi>Spira</hi> and others in the like caſe, that he is damned, he is damned; or but as <hi>David</hi> ſometimes did, that God hath forgotten to be gracious to him, and ſhut up his loving kindneſs towards him in diſpleaſure; I ſay, he that thinks the latter of theſe, though upon a Throne, the leſs miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table of the two, knows not what he ſaith, not whereof he affirms. Should he be tranſlated from a dunghill to a throne with ſuch different circumſtances as theſe, oh how would he long to be upon his dunghill again, with ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in his mouth and heart, as was that of <hi>Job,</hi> I know my redeemer lives?</p>
                     <p>If thy affliction be but temporal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, fear to ſay, no ſorrow like to thine, no not that of a wounded conſcience; leſt God hear it and be angry, and ſhould either exchange thy other miſery for a wounded conſcience, or add
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60264:249"/>that to all the reſt, that by woful experience thou maiſt learn, neither to overvalue the one, nor to undervalue the other. And do the pangs of a wounded conſcience far exceed the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of an impoveriſhed condition, what then do the pains of hell, which far exceed the pangs of conſcience? The worm that never dies (by which is meant a gnawing conſcience) is but one part of the torments of hell. Beſides that, there is the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone; the ſmoak whereof aſcendeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. What is it to have fire conſume our dwellings, in compariſon of dwelling our ſelves with conſuming fire, and with everſtaſting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings? who believes hell to be what it is, and doth not think one year or moneth in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that place, to be more unſufferable than all the vexations of a long and afflicted life; were it not leſs miſery to be as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that beggar, full of ſores, and craving of the crumbs that fell from the rich mans table, and glad of dogs to lick his fores, yea to be ſo for many years together, than for the ſpace of one year to be as <hi>Dives</hi> in hell, carneſtly begging for a little water to cool his tongue, tormented in flames, and could by no means obtain it? Add the circumſtance of eternity to the greatneſs of hell torments, and ſee if all the troubles of this life do not even vaniſh before it, and appear as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. If then thou art convinced (as I hope thou art) there is a hell, and haſt reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that multitudes are there (for all are there that have lived and died in their ſins) let me ſuppoſe thee the greateſt ſuſterer this fire hath made (if there be any one greater than any of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60264:249"/>the reſt) and when that is done, compare thy condition with that of the damned in hell, and then ſay, if thy affliction when laid in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, be not found altogether lighter than vanity. If God will aſſure thee that thou ſhalt flie from the wrath to come, all that hath yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln thee may be born.</p>
                     <p>It is not for want of pitty and commiſeration towards you, that I write this (I hope my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els yearn towards you) but I would juſtifie the Scripture, when it ſaith, that temporal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but light. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Our light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>which is but for a moment,</hi> &amp;c.

Add to what I have ſaid, that the pangs of conſcience, and the pains of hell (which I have made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, do ſo infinitely outweigh all the troubles of this life) are no other than what our ſins have deſerved, and therefore our outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions may be ſaid to be light, not only if compar'd with what is come upon others, but alſo with what might juſtly have been inflicted upon our ſelves. So that we may here take up thoſe words of <hi>Ezra, chap.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Thou Lord haſt puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve.</hi> If one that deſerves to be put to a painful and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs death, comes off with a burn in the hand, who ſaith not his puniſhment is light, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his offence? I am deceived if by this time I have not plainly proved all temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to be but light, though ſome are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like ſo light as others.</p>

                     <p>Now Lord, what I have proved by Scriptural arguments, let not me or others ever ſeem to diſprove by anti-ſcriptural practices, whilſt we affirm Temporal afflictions to be but light, let us not groan under them as if they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, or to be overwhelmed by them. Oh mix not Spiritual afflictions with temporal. If thou wilt rebuke me, ſeem not to do it in thy wrath, neither chaſten me in thy ſore diſpleaſure. Let me ready thy love in and with my temporal afflictions, and I ſhall ever acknowledge that in compariſon, not only of eternal torments, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of inward and ſpiritual troubles, they are but light.</p>

                     <p>It is a hard thought of God, that he ſhould make us drink bitter and loathſome potions, when we need them not. We cannot finde in our hearts to uſe our children ſo, nor yet to correct them (ſo much as gently) when we think there is no occaſion for it. Oh that we ſhould think more meanly of God than of our ſelves; or more highly of our ſelves than of the great and ever bleſſed God. Do we hear him crying out, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I deliver thee up Ephraim, how ſhall I make thee as Admah, and Zeboim, my heart is turned within me, &amp;c.</hi> And ſhall we think he will do ſuch things where there is no need? Take heed of charging God with hypocriſie, who is truth it ſelf. Far be it from us to ſay, Afflictions are not needful, becauſe our partial ſelves do not ſee how needful they are. When will our children confeſs that they want whipping? ſpare them till then, and you ſhall never correct them. Had <hi>Paul</hi> no need (yea he ſaith he had) of a meſſenger of Sathan to buffet him, leſt he ſhould be lifted up with the abundance of revelations? we have not his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, yet are we not as proud as he either was, or was in danger to have been? Some hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervants of God have ſaid they never had that affliction in all their lives which they did not firſt or laſt finde they had need of. He that wants no correction is better than any of thoſe worthies we read of in Scripture; and he that thinks himſelf ſo, I am ſure hath need of it to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60264:252"/>humble him. Read the <hi>third chapter,</hi> and ſee how many leſſons afflictions do teach us, and then judge if there be none of them you have yet to learn, at leaſtwiſe better and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly than you have yet done.

                     <p>NO man hath truly either a heaven or a hell in this world. For as all our wine here is mixt with water, ſo all our water is mixt with wine: God in this life doth ſtill in judgment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member mercy. <hi>God hath ſet the one over againſt

It is not for nothing that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> exhorteth us, in every thing to be thankful, and ſaith, that is the will of God concerning us: But therefore it is, becauſe there is a mixture of mercies with all the afflictions of this life. Some may ſit in ſo much darkneſs, as to ſee no light at all, but ſome light there is in their condition, only they ſee it not. Our late Fire was as great a temporal judgment as moſt have been, yet he ſeeth nothing that diſcerns not a mixture of mercy with it. Was it not great mercy that when God burnt the City, yet he ſpared the Suburbs? that when mens houſes were conſumed, yet their perſons were delivered, yea and much of their goods and ſubſtance was ſnatched as a firebrand out of the fire? your flight was on the Sabbath-day: but it was not in the winter, in which the ſhortneſs of daies, and badneſs of the waies had ſcarce permi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to have conveied away the one half of what you did, not only by day, but by night. It was no ſmall mercy that the Plague was gone before the Fire came For had it been otherwiſe, who that fled into the Countrey to ſave his life, durſt have come into the City to have ſaved his goods? Yea were not many fled ſo far from the face of that deſtroying Angel, that they could not have returned till it had been too late? Would the Countrey-men have brought their Carts and ventured their perſons if the plague had ſtill been raging? Where could you have beſtowed your goods, yea where could you have beſtowed your ſelves if the peſtilence had bin then amongſt you? who would have received them? yea who
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60264:253"/>would have received you, if you had come from thence. The City could not dread the fire more than the Countrey would have done the peſtilence, and ſuch as had come from the place where it was. So far would they have been from putting your goods into their houſes, that they would not have received your perſons into their barns and ſtables; which in the height of the plague they refuſed to do. When the fire burnt your City, there was no more it could do; but had an invading enemy ſet the City on fire, would they not alſo have rifled your goods, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed your wives, deſlowred your daughters, and put your ſelves to the ſword? Was it no mercy that God by ſparing a remnant of the City, kept it from being like to <hi>Sodom</hi> and to <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> that there is ſomething left, out of which to make a little of every thing? Some places for affemblies yet to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in; ſome for Magiſtrates to diſpence juſtice in, ſome for Merchants and traders to meet and hold commerce in, ſome houſes for perſons yet to dwell in, who cannot conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutly dwell any where elſe, though now men crowd together as in the winter-time three or four might do into one bed, or the moſt in a family into ſome little warm parlour, which in the heat of weather had wont to keep in ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rooms.</p>

You want not a place to ſtand in, if that may enable you to turn and wind the world. If then our condition be not all miſery, why ſhould our poſture be all mourning? If
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60264:254"/>we receive good things at the hands of God, why ſhould we not alſo receive evil? Children can brook correction from their parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have all things elſe from them. Out of the mouth of the moſt high proceedeth not good, as well as evil? Is it God that taketh away, and is it not God that leaves alſo? <hi>Job</hi> 2.10. and ſhould we not therefore bleſs the name of the Lord? Doth God create darkneſs, and doth he not form light alſo? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7. See how God makes the ſcales to play one againſt another; judgment in the one, mercy in the other, that it is hard to ſay which weighs heavieſt. Is it not of the Lords mercies that we are not utterly conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not? Are we ſtung with the fiery ſerpents of miſery, &amp; may we not receive ſome cure by looking up to the brazen ſerpents of mercy? (if I may ſo call them.) How can we chuſe but call to mind thoſe words of God by his Prophet? <hi>I will correct thee it meaſure, yet will I not make a full end of thee. Jer.</hi> 30.11.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, if thou hadſt mixed no mercy with our miſery, what could we do more than utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpond and caſt away all our hopes and comfort? Thou haſt mixed thy diſpenſations, let us alſo mixe our affections: hope with our fear, rejoycing with our trembling, thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with our lamentations. <hi>There is hope of a tree if it be cut down, that it will ſprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not ceaſe, if the root thereof be yet in the earth, and the ſtock thereof in the ground.

Why went the young man from Chriſt ſo ſorrowfully? <hi>Luke</hi> 18.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.22. was it not, <hi>becauſe he had great poſſeſſions,</hi> as <hi>Matthew</hi> phraſeth it; or as <hi>Luke, for that he was very rich.</hi> Thereupon ſaith Chriſt, <hi>A rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>it is eaſier for a camel to go thorough the eye of a needle;</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> muſt charge thoſe that are rich, not to be high minded, nor yet to truſt in uncertain riches, implying they are apt to both. How hard is it for thoſe that have an arm of fleſh, not to make fleſh their arm, and ſo to incur the curſe? <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. How hard it is to be ſo good a Steward of a great eſtate, as may enable a man to give up his account with joy? How many that have reſolved to be rich (yea, and have been as good as their reſolution) <hi>have pierced themſelves thorough with divers ſorrows, yea been drowned in perdition,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. When <hi>Jeſurun waxed ſat, he kicked, he forſook God that made him, and lightly eſteemed the rock of his ſalvation. Deut.</hi> 32.15. What <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.23, 30. <hi>Look not upon the Wine when it is red, when it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth its colour in the cup, when it moves its ſelf aright; at the laſt it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder,</hi> may too often be applied to proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which looks and taſtes like ſparkling wine, but oft times proves a ſtinging ſerpent. I doubt not but the time will come when many rich men will wiſh they had begd their bread, rather than to have had ſo heavie an account to give for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed proſperity.</p>
                     <p>Few men have received that hurt by their povertie that others have done by their plentie: as, for one that is ſtarved to death, there are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60264:255"/>hundreds killed with ſurfeiting upon meates or drinks. Yea <hi>adverſity</hi> hath its conveniencies and its good things, as well as proſperity its mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of diſcommodities and evil things. As one ſaid, <hi>he had received ſome hurt by his graces</hi> (which innate corruption had abuſed to pride) <hi>and ſome good by his ſins</hi> (which God had taken occaſion to humble him by, for ſo I underſtand him.) So have many received hurt by their proſperity, and good by their adverſity: been loſers by the forrner, been gainers by the latter. Many may take up the words of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and ſay, <hi>They had periſhed, if they had not periſhed.</hi> They had been undone in one ſenſe, if they had not been undone in another; or ſay as a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> I have read of, <hi>They never made a better voyage than at that time when they ſuffered ſhipwrack. Solomon</hi> knew what he ſaid, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Sorrow is better than laughter, for by the ſadneſs of the countenance the heart is made better.</hi> Sweet things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known to turn to choller (which is a bitter humour) and bitter things to cleanſe and ſweeten the blood. If then I may be better by my affliction, and might have been worſe for my proſperity; why ſhould I think my ſelf undone for the loſs of that which might have been my undoing? why ſhould I ſtand and wonder at that paſſage, <hi>James</hi> 1.10. <hi>Let the rich man rejoyce in that he is made low.</hi> Had not <hi>Manaſſes</hi> more cauſe to bleſs God for thoſe Iron fetters, wherewith he was bound by his enemies, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> than for his crown of Gold, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12. <hi>When he was in affliction, he beſought the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Proſperity had been his worſt enemy, and afterwards affliction under God became his

                     <p>When I conſider theſe things, I cannot but break out and ſay: Lord never reſtore proſperity to me, unleſs thou wilt give me a heart to uſe it, yea I rather implore affliction, (whilſt need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires) ſo thou wilt but ſanctifie it.

                     <p>COuld we take any thing ill from God's hand if we did believe he meant well? would we receive with our left hand what we thought that God did offer us with his right? all thoſe things in which God hath good ends towards us muſt needs end in our good; for the Almighty cannot be fruſtrated.

And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. That <hi>God chaſtneth us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his Holineſs.</hi> To think that God would correct his children but for ſome good end, what is it but to think more hardly of God than we do of our ſelves, who uſe to ſay, but that we think it for their good, we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtrike a Childe whilſt we lived, nor ſhould it feel the weight of our finger. Is not God as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſtrike as you can be, if fair meanes would ſerve the turn? how ſhall I give thee up oh <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but either he muſt take ſuch a courſe with us, or it will be worſe for us. Even then when the meanes which God uſeth are the fruits of juſtice and diſpleaſure, the end which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth in ſo doing, is the reſult of his mercy. Though the Husband-man break up the ground, plow upon its back, and make long furrowes, he intends no hurt, all is to prepare it for the ſeec. Whatſoever the face of Gods actions or actings towards his people may be, to be ſure he hath alwayes good intentions as towards them, for <hi>he is tender of them as of the apple of his eye, Zach.</hi> 2.8. And give me leave to ſay there is a great deale more comfort in the good meanings of God than of men; becauſe men may meane well, when yet they may do very ill: yea that very thing which they deſigned for much good, may do much hurt. The <hi>Amalekite</hi> that told <hi>David</hi> he had killed <hi>Saul,</hi> deſigned to get a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for himſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.2. but we ſee it coſt him his life. But the deſignes of God cannot be defeated. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.21. <hi>The counſell of the Lord
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60264:257"/>that ſhall ſtand. Job</hi> 23.13. <hi>He is of one minde, and who can turn him, and what his ſoul deſireth that he doth.</hi> It is yet a further comfort that we may not only know in the general that God intends the good of his people in afflicting them, but alſo in particular that he intends our good thereby.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>firſt</hi> of all, If it be ſo that God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us hungrings and thirſtings after a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied uſe of our afflictions, ſo that we more long to be brought out of ſin by affliction, than to be brought out of affliction by deliverance: we may be conſident, he that created thoſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grings and thirſtings after learning righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the judgments that are upon us, and obedience by our ſufferings, will ſatisfie them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moreover,</hi> If God hath given us a ſanctified uſe of mercies time after time, if mercies have done us good; afflictions ſhall do ſo likewiſe. We ſometimes give out children delightful things, only to pleaſe them: but not diſtaſtful things, unleſs it be to profit them; neither will God do otherwiſe by his children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again,</hi> If afflictions actually do us good, and make us better, we may be ſure they were ſent of God for that end and purpoſe: for it is not by accident, but by divine appointment that evil things ſhould do us good; though it is true they may do us hurt thorough our own default, how be it God had made them capable of doing us good, if we had not abuſed them. We can bring evil out of good, and darkneſs out of light: but it is God only that can bring good out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and light out of darkneſs. God ſometimes

                     <p>O Lord how uſual is it with us to double and treble our miſeries, by miſinterpreting the ends of God in inflicting them, as if thou didſt it only to wreak thine anger upon us, and to wreak thy wrath from heaven againſt us, as if thou didſt whet thy glittering ſword that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt render vengeance, when yet <hi>thou chaſteneſt us only as a Man chaſtneth his Son, Deut.</hi> 8.5. how oft do we think that thou haſt laid thy Axe to our Root, when it is but thy Pruning-hook to our ſuperfluous branches: Doth it not grieve thy ſpirit to be thus miſconſtrued and hardly thought of, as it would cut us to the heart to be miſtaken for enemies, when we have done and ſpoken as true friends?

                     </head>
                     <p>HOw good is it to be willing to be at God's diſpoſe? how meet is it to be ſaid to God,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60264:258"/>not as I will, but as thou wilt? ſhall we pray (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath taught us) that the will of God may be done, and yet be impatient of Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own will? Is it fit that Gods will ſhould take place or ours? who are we that we ſhould ſet our ſelves to contradict and oppoſe the good pleaſure of God, be it that our houſes ſhall be fired, our goods burnt, our head City laid waſt. Did <hi>Abraham</hi> withſtand God when he bid him to ſacrifice his dear <hi>Iſaac</hi> (the heire of promiſe) with his own hand? Did he not, as to that, lie at Gods foot when he called him to it? Are we better than <hi>Moſes,</hi> then <hi>Aaron</hi> the Saint of the Lord, than <hi>David,</hi> than <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> than <hi>Job,</hi> yea than <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who had all learn'd to ſtoop to God in very difficult caſes? Can we be too good to do it, if they were not? When God told <hi>Moſes</hi> he ſhould go up to <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah,</hi> and take a view of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but that he ſhould never enter into it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.27. We finde not one word that he replyed, after he had once made his requeſt, and God had ſaid, ſpeak no more of this matter. When God had by fire conſumed <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> the two Sons of <hi>Aaron, Moſes</hi> did but ſay to him, <hi>The Lord will be ſanctified in them that come nigh to him, and be glorified before all the people, and Aaron held his peace, Levit.</hi> 10.3. When old <hi>Eli</hi> had received a dreadfull meſſage from God by a Child, for ſo <hi>Samuel</hi> then was, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. How meekly did he reſent it, ſaying, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do as ſeemeth him good.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> was flying from the face of his rebellious Son <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and taking leave of the Ark of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. <hi>If the Lord ſay I have no delight in thee, behold here
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60264:258"/>am I, let him do to me what ſeemeth him good?</hi> At another time, when <hi>David</hi> was even conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the blow of Gods hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.10. he ſaith, <hi>I was dumb and opened not my mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou didſt it. verſ.</hi> 9. And as for <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though a King alſo, (as well as <hi>David</hi>) yet ſee how his ſpirit buckled to God, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet brought him word, that God had taken away the fee-ſimple of all he had from his <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who ſhould be Eunuches to the King of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Iſa.</hi> 39.7. And left him but his life in it. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which thou haſt ſpoken, verſ.</hi> 8. As for <hi>Job</hi> who had been the greateſt of all the Men of the Eaſt, when he had loſt all but a vexatious Wife, prompting him to curſe God, vet cried he out, <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, Job</hi> 1.21.</p>
                     <p>Behold a greater inſtance of patience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion than any of theſe, both for that his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was more excellent, and his ſufferings far greater, having been a Man of ſorrowes all his time. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. <hi>He was oppreſſed and he was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, yet he opened not his mouth, brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a Sheep before the Shearer is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth. When he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled he reviled not again: when he ſuffered he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. Was not this written for our imitation? <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example.</hi> Did he, who is God equal with the father, ſubmit even to the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſhamefull, and curſed death of the croſs, and ſhall we think our ſelves too good to ſtoop to leſſer ſufferings and humiliations? he that can ſubmit to God, may be happy in any condition:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60264:259"/>he that cannot, will be happy in no condition this World can afford him, in which all our roſes are full of prickles, and all our wayes ſtrowed and hedged up with thornes, more or leſs. Yea not only the Church militant upon Earth, but even the Church triumphant, in heaven, could not be free from miſery, if the will of glorious Saints were not melted into the will of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> would be ever and anon grieving to think of <hi>Dives</hi> and others in his caſe, if his will were not perfectly conformed to the will of God. Many things fall out in this life, which we would not for a World ſhould be, if we could and might prevent them; but when the pleaſure of God is once declared by events, even in thoſe caſes ought we to ſit down ſatisfied. <hi>Abraham</hi> would not have ſacrificed <hi>Iſaac</hi> for the whole World, but that God made as if he would have him ſo to do, and then he yielded preſently. If blinde fortune did govern the World, whoſe heart would it not break to think of ſo famous a City in a few dayes laid in aſhes: but ſith it was the will of God it ſhould be ſo, who ordereth all things according to the counſel of his will, let all the Earth be ſilent before him, let us be ſtill and know that he is God. Who ſhould rule the World but he that made it, and that upholds it by the Word of his Power? He can do us no wrong if he would, ſuch is his eſſential holineſs, (which alſo makes it impoſſible for him to lie) he would do us no wrong if he could, ſuch is his infinite juſtice. He can do nothing but what is conſiſtent with infinite wiſdome, patience, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, mercy, and every perfection, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable is it not to ſubmit to that which is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60264:259"/>conſiſtent with all of theſe? ſo doubtleſs was the burning of our renowned City (as ghaſtly a ſpectacle as it is to behold) elſe it had never come to paſs.</p>
                     <p>O Lord I am ſenſible that I have need of line upon line, precept upon precept, and example upon example, to teach me this hard leſſon of ſubmiſſion to thee (though the object of that ſubmiſſion ſeem to be only my condition in this life) for I no where finde that thou requireſt me and others to be willing to periſh everlaſtingly) Thou knoweſt how much thy glory and the comfort of thy poor Creatures are concerned in it, that we ſhould know how to reſign up our ſelves to thee; inable us to be contented with whatſoever thy will hath been or ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, and then be pleaſed to do with us (as to this World) what thou wilt.</p>

                     <p>IF a glorious City turned into a ruinous heap in four dayes time, when no viſible enemy was at hand to do it: if the reducing hundreds of Families to almoſt beggery, that liv'd in good faſhion in leſs than one week before, by an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected meanes, and in a way not poſſible to be foreſeen: if knocking a Nation out of joynt all of a ſudden (like a body that had been tortured upon a Rack) be not loud Sermons of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and uncertainty of all earthly things, ſurely
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60264:260"/>there will be none ſuch till that time ſhall come, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. <hi>When the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with ſervent heat, the Earth alſo, and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi> What a Comment was this providence upon that Text, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5. <hi>Verily every Man at his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity?</hi> How did it evince the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to ſpeak right, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.9. Not only when he ſaith, <hi>Men of low degree are vanity,</hi> (which moſt people do believe) but alſo when he ſaith, <hi>Men of high degree are a lie, to be laid in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance they are altogether lighter than vanity</hi> (which few aſſent unto.) If things are called vanity (as moſt properly they are) from their aptneſs, to vaniſh and diſappear, from their taking wings and flying away from us: then ſurely the vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flying away of a famous City upon the wings of the fire, and of the wind, (which were the bellowes inraging that fire) are a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the vanity of all things here below.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt all ſublunary things, what could be thought to have more ſtability and certainty in it than the City of <hi>London</hi> had, as to the body and bulk of it? elſe why were ſo many wiſe men willing to venture all they had in the world in that one bottome? Moſt men dreampt as little of the burning of all, or the moſt of <hi>London,</hi> as of burning up the whole World before the day of Judgment: and it is like did think it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable, but upon the matter impoſſible, as not doubting, but if fire did happen in any part of the City, one or more, there would be men and meanes enough to extinguiſh it (as they uſe to do) This Mountain was thought to ſtand
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60264:260"/>ſo ſtrong, as that it could not be removed in ſuch a way as it was. He that had ſaid, but what if the whole City ſhould be burnt? would have been anſwered by moſt men, with the Proverb, <hi>what if the skie ſhould fall?</hi> yet have we ſeen this <hi>famous City</hi> wither like <hi>Jonah's Gourd,</hi> though not in one day, yet in a very few. May we not apply to it thoſe words of <hi>David,</hi> uſed in another caſe, we have lately ſeen it in great power, ſpreading it ſelf like a green Bay Tree: we paſſed by, and loe it was not, we ſought it, and it could not be found. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.35. Who can but think of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s expreſſions upon this occaſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.5. <hi>A man was famous accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he had lifted up Axes upon the thick Trees,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in order to building the Temple: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to build the City, or any part of it) <hi>but now they break down the carved work thereof with Axes and Hammers:</hi> ſuch execution hath the Fire done, that greater could not have been done, nor yet ſo great by Axes and Hammers, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. and 8. <hi>They have caſt Fire into the Sanctuary, they have burnt up the Synagogues of God in the Land.</hi> We read of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s being <hi>overthrown in a moment and no hands ſtayed on her, Lam.</hi> 4.6. Was it not ſo with <hi>London?</hi> Is any Man's life ſo certain as the continuance of <hi>London</hi> was thought to be? Who did not expect that both he and his ſhould have been in their Graves before <hi>London</hi> had come to lie in aſhes? who thought not that the City, which had ſurvived many ages paſt, would alſo have ſurvived many ages to come? who would not have thought that a Leaſe for ſo long as <hi>London</hi> ſhould ſtand, had been more durable than if it had run for the lives of a hundred men?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60264:261"/>yet even in it have we ſeen thoſe words fulfilled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6. <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof as the flower of the Field. Pſal.</hi> 90.6. <hi>In the morning it flouriſheth and groweth up, in the evening it is cut down and withered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But may ſome ſay, <hi>Land</hi> is certain, though houſes be caſual, neither can moth eat it, nor ruſt corrupt it, nor theeves ſteale it, nor yet fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it; for that matter, all that can be ſaid, Land is like to ſtand where it is, but that it will alwayes abide by the preſent and proper owners of it, that is as uncertain as any thing elſe. If <hi>Ahab</hi> have a minde to <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, <hi>Jezabel</hi> knowes how to get it for him, though <hi>Naboth</hi> would not part with it. It is but paper and parchment that men have to ſhow for their Lands, and are not they more eaſily conſumed than a whole City: or may they not be loſt or ſtollen, or ſo bafled by the artifice of corrupt Lawyers, that they ſhall do us no good? we ſee then that which was lookt upon by all men to be as great a certainty as this World hath any, is dried up like a deceitfull Brook in Summer. <hi>Job</hi> 6.17.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, when I remember theſe things, I cannot but pour out my ſoul in me, and my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication unto thee, ſaying. O Lord, give me not my portion in theſe things, which may ſo eaſily be taken away, ſuffer me not to ſet my heart upon things, of which it is ſaid, they are not, becauſe they take wings &amp; flie away, but give me to inherit durable ſubſtance, (or that which <hi>is,</hi> as thou haſt called it, Heb. <hi>teſh. Prov.</hi>) Fire me out of the love of the World, by what thou haſt done to the City, and give me to minde what
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60264:261"/>thou haſt ſaid, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world, for the world paſſeth away, &amp;c.</hi> Give me to conſider how miſerable I am, if I have intereſt in no good things, but thoſe which one nights fire, or one daies trial at law may take away from me? I ſee we are all te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants at will, as to all we have in this world, and thou ſealeſt a leaſe of ejectment when thou pleaſeſt: but there is an inheritance incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that fadeth not away, reſerved for thy people in the heavens. Oh give us here an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant entrance into it, and hereafter the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs poſſeſſion of it. And as experience ſheweth us the vanity of all things here below, let us by means of faith, which is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and evidence of things not ſeen, foreſee the reality, and in part fore-enjoy the ſweetneſs of thoſe better things that are above.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60264:262"/>ſtarved, when they come at meat again, are apt to ſurfeit. Now God hath burnt your former houſes, take heed of burning your own fingers, in hiring new ones at too great Fines and Rents. Remember the words of God to <hi>Baruch, Jer.</hi> 45.4. <hi>Behold that which I have built will I break down; and ſeekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf?</hi> See the world better, before you have more to do with it than you needs muſt; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that draw a breaſt too hard, that hath but little in it, what do they but fill themſelves with wind? Truſt not your ſelves too far with the world, for it is a ſlippery thing, and may ſerve you ſuch another trick: who would toile, as in the Fire, to lay up treaſure for another Fire to conſume? Ought <hi>they that have wives</hi> (and not much more they that have trades) <hi>to be as though they had none?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30. <hi>Becauſe the faſhion of the world paſſeth away.</hi> A moderate care to recruit ſome part of our loſſes is not to be blamed: but an immoderate, will do more hurt than good. <hi>They that will be rich</hi> (be it after great loſſes) <hi>fall into temptation and a ſnare,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. It is not for us to ſay we will be rich, then of all times, when God hath ſaid in effect that he will have us poor: though wait upon his providence we may and muſt, for a convenient ſubſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, thou haſt given us fair warning not to ſet our hearts upon this world, or flie too faſt after that which flies ſo faſt away from us. Sin and the world are two enemies we are not bound to love; yea, we are bound not to love the firſt at all, the laſt, much. Seeing it is the pleaſure of God to take the world from us, let us take off our hearts from it. If God withdraw
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60264:262"/>ſpiritual mercies, it is to make us purſue them more eagerly; but if he withdraw temporal, it is that we ſhould proſecute them more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. It being one of thy deſigns, O Lord, in taking part of this world from us, to make us mind this leſs, and the next, more; far be it from us upon that account to minde this world more, and that which is to come, leſs; or to rob our general calling, to recruit our particular; when we ſhould rather borrow time from our particular callings which thou haſt diminiſhed, to add to our general. <hi>O Lord,</hi> teach us nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deal with a ſlack hand (which thou haſt ſaid, tends to poverty) not yet to be ſo hot upon it, as if we were reſolved by the fire of our zeal for the world, certainly to repair what thou haſt impaired by the fire of thine anger: but give us rather to ſtudy how contentedly and comfortably we may live for leſs, than how we may regain and repoſſeſs as much as ever.</p>

                     <p>IT is the greateſt miſery that attends a ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring condition, that it tempts men to ſeek a deliverance by ſin. <hi>Agur</hi> gives this reaſon why he deprecated poverty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I be poor and ſteal, and take the name of the Lord in vain.</hi> Even Theft its ſelf is a taking of Gods name in vain, as being a practical deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods alſufficience to provide for us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

It were eaſie to recount many indirect courſes which are taken by men and women, utterly to defend themſelves againſt want. Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to unlawful trades, no leſs than proſtituting their own bodies, or the bodies of others, therewith to provide for their backs and bellies; ſome have other trades as bad as that (if ſo bad can be;) others uſe lawful cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings unlawfully, vending bad commodities, taking unconſcionable rates, pinching thoſe poor people that work to them. Some go the way of open violence, (as by robbery, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, oppreſſion,) others the no leſs diſhoneſt way, of ſecret fraud and couſenage. Some are tempted to break, not becauſe they cannot pay their debts and live: but becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live ſo as they were wont to do if they ſhould pay their debts, and therefore they will rather defraud their Creditors, than their <hi>Genius.</hi> Some, if God take away from them but ſome part of what he hath given them, reſolve to lend him nothing (in that ſenſe as they who give to the poor, are ſaid to lend to the Lord) not but that they are more able than ſome others who are careful to maintain good works, and to be very charitable: but becauſe they are not ſo able as they have been; as who ſhould ſay, if God impair his wonted bounty towards them, (though much of his bounty be ſtill extended towards them, howbeit not ſo much as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) they will put an imbargo upon all their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nothing ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60264:263"/>ſounds like taking ſome kind of revenge upon God himſelf.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh the words of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 10.9. were not applicable to many, where ſpeaking of a wicked man, he ſaith, <hi>He lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net.</hi> Are there not many that work upon the neceſſities of poor men, and grinde their faces when they have them at an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? Theſe are ſome of the ill methods and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices whereby too many attempt to make up their loſſes. But better it were to be alwaies poor, than to grow rich by ſuch waies as theſe. Where ſin is made uſe of as the cure of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the remedy is worſe than the diſeaſe, and it is as our <hi>Proverb</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Out of the Frying-pan into the Fire.</hi> Deliverance obtained by ſin is like <hi>Jacob's</hi> bleſſing procured by lying, which was many waies imbittered to him: For none of all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had ſo many croſſes as he. Sin is a worſe labyrinth than affliction: worſe to ſtay in, and worſe to get out of. So <hi>David</hi> found it when he would have concealed his ſhame in the matter of <hi>Bathſhebah</hi> by making <hi>Uriah</hi> drunk, that would not do his buſineſs, neither did he ſee how he could effect his deſign without kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him: and when that was done, he was in a worſe caſe than ever; for then watered he his couch with his tears, then were his bones bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. So <hi>Peter</hi> thought to have ſecured himſelf, by denying his maſter: but that denying coſt him dearer than it is probable his owning of Chriſt at that time would have done. All that men truly get by ſin, they may put in their eyes (as we ſay) and not ſee the worſe. What had
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60264:264"/>become of <hi>Job</hi> if he had followed the wicked counſel which his wife gave him, whereby to put an end to his troubles? ſaying, <hi>Curſe God and die.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let thoſe that are tempted to repair their loſſes by indirect means, think but of three Texts. The firſt is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.6. <hi>The getting of creaſure by a lying tongue, is a vanity toſſed to and fro of them that ſeek death.</hi> The next is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.16. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the poor to encreaſe his riches, ſhall ſurely come to want.</hi> The laſt is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. <hi>As the Partridge ſitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not: ſo he that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his daies, and at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi> But as for thoſe that chuſe rather to ſuffer than to ſin, God taketh a particular care of them: witneſs <hi>Daniel,</hi> preſerved in the Lions den; and the three children in the fiery furnace. They that ſin under ſufferings, what do they but take in more lading in a ſtorm, whereas the uſual and beſt way is, to caſt out part of that lading which they had taken in before.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, I deſire to depend upon this, that thou knoweſt how to deliver the righteous out of temptations; and that without their unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Let not the lot of the wicked ſo long reſt upon the backs of thy ſervants, as to make them put forth their hands to wickedneſs. Cauſe us to believe, that thy bleſſing only ſo maketh rich, as to add no ſorrow therewith. and let us never forget or miſdoubt what thou ſaidſt to thy ſervant <hi>Abraham,</hi> I am God all-ſufficiernt, walk thou before me and be upright. Doubtleſs a little which a righteous man hath
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60264:264"/>is better than great treaſures of the wicked. Let me ever be perſwaded (as I hope I now am) that innocent poverty is much more elegible than ill gotten proſperity.</p>

How much leſs difficult had it been for a burning ſeaver to have conſumed me (and thouſands more ſuch as I am) than for ſuch a fire, as did that work to have conſum'd <hi>London?</hi> For <hi>is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones? or is my fleſh of braſs?</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.12. Such was the ſtrength of that <hi>City,</hi> and yet ſee where it lieth. As for <hi>London</hi> its ſelf, it was a glorious <hi>City,</hi> beautiful for ſcituation, and I had almoſt called it the joy of the whole earth, alluding to what was ſaid of Mount <hi>Sion, Pſal.</hi> 48.2. (to be ſure the joy of the three Kingdoms) but the inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi> as to their bodies, what were they but dwellers in houſes of clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt, which might be cruſht before the moth? <hi>Job</hi> 4.19. Who look not upon
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60264:265"/>ſtrong-built houſes as things more durable than their inhabitants? who did not hope if they were their own, to tranſmit them to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and childrens children to many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? And yet we ſee that they are in the duſt before us. And is not that a fair warning to us, as it might be to an aged infirm perſon, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a young luſtie perſon to the grave. If this were done to the green tree, what may not the dry expect? If the beſt houſes in <hi>London</hi> were half a year ſince not really worth three years purchaſe, how ever men did value them, how ſmall a purchaſe may our lives be worth for ought we know? Many might reckon to lay their ruins (their carcaſſes I mean) in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of <hi>London,</hi> but who ever thought to have had his carcaſs interred in the ruins of <hi>London?</hi> as ſome have had already. A little time hath produced a greater change than our great change would be, why then ſhould we put the evil day of death far off? why ſhould we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our ſelves length of daies, as if the preſent year might not put a period to us, as well as to a ſtrong and ſtately City, that was likely to have out-laſted a thouſand of us.</p>
                     <p>How reaſonable is it then for us whoſe lives are but a vapor, to expect but a ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this world, at leaſtwiſe not to expect any long duration here; to ſay with the <hi>Apoſtle, The time is ſhort.</hi> Yea, how needful is it we ſhould take the counſel which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35. <hi>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, And your ſelves like men that wait for the Lord, that when he knocketh they may open to him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</hi> As there is no preparing for death
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60264:265"/>without thinking of it, ſo who can think of death, and not deſire to prepare for it? if the deſtruction of <hi>London</hi> admoniſh us to number out dayes, it doth no leſs, to apply our hearts to wiſdome. Who would be willing to die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedly, that thinks at all of dying?</p>
                     <p>That you may know what I mean by prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs for death, take this account. Then is a man fit to die, when he is in a condition to die both ſafely and comfortably: when he is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from ſpiritual death to life, and knowes himſelf ſo to be. He that is not ſo tranſlated, hath no fitneſs at all to die, he that is and knows it not, is fit in one ſenſe, and unfit in another: is partly fit, but not ſo compleatly, but he that both is ſo, and knows himſelf to be ſo, hath all the eſſentials of fitneſs for death, though if a man be in the actual exerciſe of grace and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his duty, it muſt be confeſſed that doth give him ſomewhat more of an actual and accompliſhed fitneſs, than the meer habits of grace and of aſſurance can do. He that hath made his calling and election ſure, he that is ſealed up to the day of redemption by the ſpirit of promiſe, he that can ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> he knows in whom he hath truſted, and as St. <hi>John,</hi> we know that we are of God; I ſay is fit to die. He that hath not that fitneſs for death, but yet deſires to have it, let him make it part of every daies work to get it; let him be daily learning how to die. Hath God afforded no meanes whereby to bring us to a fitneſs for death? what is prayer, reading the Scriptures, hearing the word, converſe with Chriſtians, examining our ſelves, ſerious meditation of ſpiritual and eternal
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60264:266"/>things, avoiding the occaſions of evil, keeping our hearts with all diligence? Is it likely that a man ſhould conſcionably uſe all theſe meanes, and not attain the end of them? why then is faith ſaid to come by hearing the word preached? why is the word called the miniſtration of the ſpirit? why ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians, Received ye not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by the hearing of faith? Gal.</hi> 3.2. why did <hi>Chriſt</hi> counſel men to ſearch the Scriptures, ſeeming to approve their thinking, that in them we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life? why doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeak of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father, giving his ſpirit to them that ask him? why doth he ſay, <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall finde, knock and it ſhall be opened to you, Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>For every one that asketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened, verſ.</hi> 8. why muſt all that come to God, believe that God is a rewarder of all them that ſeek him diligently? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. It ſeems to conſiſt but ill with ſuch texts as theſe, for us to look upon the means which God hath appointed as inſignificant and ineffectual. And ſeeing they are not ſo, let us diligently uſe them in order to our preparation for death, now at leaſtwiſe that God hath ſpared us ſo long as to ſee <hi>London</hi> laid in the duſt before us.</p>
                     <p>Now God hath fired your neſts over your heads <hi>(dear friends and much lamented Citizens)</hi> will not each of you ſay as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 55.6. <hi>O that I had wings like a Dove</hi> (which is the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of innocency) <hi>for then would I flie away, and be at reſt.</hi> I ſee no great reaſon we now have to be fond of life, if we were but fit to die. May we not ſay with <hi>Solomon,</hi> we have ſeen an end of all perfection? Seeing we have brought forth an
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60264:266"/>
                        <hi>Icabod</hi> (ſo far as concernes our ſelves only, and in reference to this World) what great matter had it been, if with <hi>Eli</hi>'s daughter in Law we had died in Childbed? Now who would not long to be diſſolved, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, if he could but ſay with him, <hi>We know if our Earthly Houſe were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                     <p>O ſee then as concerning Death, there are three leſſons to be learnt from this ſad providence. <hi>viz.</hi> to expect it, to prepare for it, and to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to it. To expect it, is the way to prepare for it: and when once prepared for it, we have no great reaſon, after ſuch a deſolation, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to it.</p>
                     <p>O Lord I dare not ſay, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.4. <hi>It is enough, take away my life.</hi> He might better ſay ſo than I. Poſſibly he foreſaw by a ſpirit of propheſie, that fiery Chariot which was intended to carry him to heaven. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.12. Yet neither he nor I may ſay ſo by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. O <hi>Lord,</hi> I have many things to deſire, as in reference to death, let me not die till I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, make me willing when I am fit, let me know I am fit when I am really ſo, that I may be willing, make me early fit, that I may be timely willing: yea deſirous to be diſſolved, and whenſoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> am deſirous to dye, let me alſo be contented to live, if thou have any work to do for me. Let me only deſire that thou maiſt be glorified in me, whether by life or death. <hi>Lord</hi> what work do I and ſome others make of dying, as if it were more for us to die, than for <hi>London</hi> to be burnt to aſhes. Did <hi>Aaron</hi> make any ſuch ſtir about it? Up he went to Mount <hi>Hor. Moſes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60264:267"/>ſtript him of his Garments, and put them upon Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar his Son: Numb.</hi> 20.26. And me thinks he made no more of it, than if he had put off his cloaths to go to Bed, or than if with <hi>Enoch,</hi> he had been about to have been tranſlated, rather than to have ſeen death; or with <hi>Chriſt</hi> after his reſurrection, rather about to aſcend than to die. O <hi>Lord</hi> have not ſome of thy ſervants known the time of their approaching Death, and knowing it, called their friends about them, prayed together, ſuing Pſalmes together, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confer'd about that better world they were going to, took their ſolemn leave of all their relations and friends, as if they had only been about to travel into ſome far Country, from whence they were never like to return again, and then compoſed themſelves to die, as if they had only laid themſelves to ſleep, and commended their ſouls into thy hands with no leſs chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confidence, than Men do their bags and bonds into the hands of faithful friends? May I not (with ſubmiſſion) deſire to die upon the ſame termes? yet, if it may ſtand with thy bleſſed will, let me live to ſee <hi>London</hi> rebuilt in ſome competent meaſure: thy people re-united: <hi>England</hi> reſetled: Proteſtant Nations reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led each to other: thy Goſpel every where ſpread: this Land a Mountain of holineſs, and a valley of viſion, or if not all, yea if none of theſe, at leaſtwiſe clearly to ſee and read my own name written in the book of life: then ſhall I ſay with good old <hi>Simeon, Now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi>
